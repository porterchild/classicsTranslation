          <p class="passage">Tell me, O Muse, of that ingenious hero who travelled far and wide after he had sacked the famous town of Troy. Many cities did he visit, and many were the nations with whose manners and customs he was acquainted; moreover he suffered much by sea while trying to save his own life and bring his men safely home; but do what he might he could not save his men, for they perished through their own sheer folly in eating the cattle of the Sun-god Hyperion; so the god prevented them from ever reaching home. Tell me, too, about all these things, oh daughter of Jove, from whatsoever source you may know them.

So now all who escaped death in battle or by shipwreck had got safely home except Ulysses, and he, though he was longing to return to his wife and country, was detained by the goddess Calypso, who had got him into a large cave and wanted to marry him. But as years went by, there came a time when the gods settled that he should go back to Ithaca; even then, however, when he was among his own people, his troubles were not yet over; nevertheless all the gods had now begun to pity him except Neptune, who still persecuted him without ceasing and would not let him get home.</p>

          <p class="passage">He was out there fighting tooth and nail — trying to save his own soul and get his crew back home safe. But y'all — even with all that heart, he couldn't save his homies. Couldn't save nobody. 'Cause they went and perished on their own reckless mess, straight fools chowing down on them cows belongin' to the Sun God Hyperion. Baby, don't get it twisted — that was all on them. And him? He snatched away their homecoming day, just like that.

Now from right there, goddess Athena — Zeus's own baby girl — tell us how it went down, feel me?

Listen, all them others, every last one who dodged that grim death, they was home now — slipped the war and the wild sea both. But this one man, cut off from homecoming and his wife, that nymph Calypso — top goddess queen — she had him hemmed up in them hollow caves, stay pressed for him to be her husband. Y'all know she stay wanting that man.

But see, when that year rolled up in them turnin' seasons — boom, the gods fixed it: time to ship out to Ithaca. But even there, he ain't free from trials, ain't back with his loved ones yet. All the gods pitied him deep — everybody but Poseidon. That one stayed raging. Raging hard at that man Odysseus, sharp as a blade. Wouldn't let up till he touched his own land. But right then? Poseidon was off visiting them Ethiopians, way way out there — them folks split clean in two, remotest of all men, some where the Sun be droppin' low, others catchin' his rise.</p>

          <p class="passage">Well now, he tried his level best to save his own soul and get his buddies home too. But Lord have mercy, he couldn't save a one of 'em, no matter how bad he wanted to. On account of their own fool ways, they all perished — plumb foolish, eatin' them cows that belonged to the Sun. And he just up and took their homecomin' day right away from 'em.

Well, from right there on, O goddess, daughter of the good Lord Zeus, you tell us now too. I'll tell you what happened next. All them others — every last one that slipped past that grim death, past the fightin' and the ragin' sea — they made it home. But this man here, cut off from his homecomin' and his wife, bless her heart, Miss Calypso — that nymph, fine goddess among 'em — she kept him holed up in her deep sea caves, longin' somethin' fierce to make him her husband.

But when that year finally come around — after all them circlin' years had passed — the gods fixed it for him to head on home to Ithaca. Even so, he warn't gonna dodge his troubles there, nor find his dear ones waitin'. All the gods took pity on him, every one, 'cept old Poseidon. He kept on ragin' somethin' awful at that man Odysseus, wouldn't quit till he touched that home soil.

But him? He was off visitin' them Ethiopians, way far off — I tell you, way out yonder. Ethiopians split clean in two, the outermost folks of all — some where the Sun goes down dark, others where he's just comin' up.</p>

          <p class="passage">He'd tried to save his own skin and get his men home. No good. They died on their own hook—fools who ate the Sun's cattle. The kind of meal you take once. The Sun canceled their ride back. Minerva picked it up from there. Jove's daughter. The kind who gets the story straight. All the others who'd slipped war and sea made it to their doors. Him alone. No ticket home. No wife. Calypso had him pinned down. The nymph goddess. Kept him in those deep caves of hers, set on making him her husband—the kind that sticks. But when the year circled back—the one the gods marked for Ithaca—even then he wasn't clear. Still tangled in trials, cut off from his friends. The gods pitied him. All but Neptune. He nursed the grudge against Ulysses—godlike in his dodges—right up to landfall. Neptune was off with the Ethiopians. Far out. Farthest men going. Split down the middle—half where the Sun dives under, half where it hauls up.</p>

          <p class="passage">On this he took his leave, and Calypso went out to look for Ulysses, for she had heard Jove's message. She found him sitting upon the beach with his eyes ever filled with tears, and dying of sheer home sickness; for he had got tired of Calypso, and though he was forced to sleep with her in the cave by night, it was she, not he, that would have it so. As for the day time, he spent it on the rocks and on the sea shore, weeping, crying aloud for his despair, and always looking out upon the sea. Calypso then went close up to him said:

"My poor fellow, you shall not stay here grieving and fretting your life out any longer. I am going to send you away of my own free will; so go, cut some beams of wood, and make yourself a large raft with an upper deck that it may carry you safely over the sea. I will put bread, wine, and water on board to save you from starving. I will also give you clothes, and will send you a fair wind to take you home, if the gods in heaven so will it—for they know more about these things, and can settle them better than I can."

Ulysses shuddered as he heard her. "Now goddess," he answered, "there is something behind all this; you cannot be really meaning to help me home when you bid me do such a dreadful thing as put to sea on a raft. Not even a well found ship with a fair wind could venture on such a distant voyage: nothing that you can say or do shall make me go on board a raft unless you first solemnly swear that you mean me no mischief."</p>

          <p class="passage">Y'all, now that she be fully tuned in to Zeus's message, she make her move. And listen—there she found him, right on that shore. Odysseus, that man who'd been through hell, sitting there. Just sitting, eyes never dry, not one time. Sweet life leaking out in tears while he moan for home, 'cause that nymph? Baby, she ain't cutting it no more—not even close. Nights, he be laid up in them carved-out caves with her, against his will, her all on it. Days? He be posted on them rocks. Them rocks and that sandy beach, soul straining with cries and groans and deep aches, staring out at that endless sea. Staring and staring, tears just pouring. She step up close, that goddess sharp as they come, and lay it on him: "Weary one—don't keep crying here, don't let your days waste away. I'm finna send you packing for real. Cut some long timbers, fit 'em wide with bronze for a raft, raise a tall mast on her so she carry you over that misty deep. I'll load her with bread and water and sweet red wine to hold off hunger, wrap you in fresh clothes. Send a fair wind blowing behind too—so if them gods want it, the ones holding wide heaven, way better than me at scheming and knowing, you touch down safe in your own land." She put it like that, and Odysseus? That long-suffering man shuddered hard. Shook deep in his bones. Then he fire back, words flying swift: "Goddess, you ain't cooking up something else with this, is you? This raft trip over that huge sea chasm? Wild and rough—ain't no swift ships make it, even dancing with Zeus's wind. I ain't stepping foot on your raft willing-like unless you swear me a mighty oath—no other harm you plotting my way."</p>

          <p class="passage">Well now, she was listenin' close to that word from the good Lord Zeus. And she found him sittin' right there on the beach, poor soul. Lord have mercy, his eyes never did dry up, no sirree. That sweet life of his was just wastin' away while he cried over gettin' home, on account of Miss Calypso didn't bring him no joy no more. Nights? Well, he'd lie up with her in them deep hollow caves — had to, like it or not. She willin' as the day is long, him not a bit. Days, he'd perch out on them rocks and headlands, heavin' his heart with tears and groans and aches, starin' over that endless-stretchin' sea that never quits, lettin' tears pour like rain off a barn roof.

Miss Calypso, she'd stand close by and speak up: 'Poor fella, don't keep cryin' here, don't let your life slip away like this. I'm fixin' to send you off, and right quick. Cut you some long timbers, join 'em up with broad bronze planks. Raise a tall mast on her, rig a yardarm too, so she'll carry you over that foggy sea. I'll stow bread and water and red wine — good eatin' to keep hunger off — and clothes to wrap you in. Send a fair wind behind you, so you make your own land safe, if them up in heaven want it so — the ones holdin' that wide sky, wiser'n me at thinkin' and judgin'.'

I'll tell you what, that long-sufferin' Odysseus, bless his heart, he shivered like a hound in a thunderstorm. He looked at her and spoke right out: 'Goddess, whatever else you're schemin' here, it sure ain't just sendin' me off. You ain't tellin' me to cross that big sea gulf on a raft — fearsome and hard as all get-out. Even the swiftest ships don't make it, not with Zeus's wind behind 'em. I reckon I ain't climbin' on no raft of yours willing-like, 'less you swear me a big oath, goddess, you ain't cookin' up no other harm for me.'</p>

          <p class="passage">And Ulysses answered, "King Alcinous, it is a good thing to hear a bard with such a divine voice as this man has. There is nothing better or more delightful than when a whole people make merry together, with the guests sitting orderly to listen, while the table is loaded with bread and meats, and the cup-bearer draws wine and fills his cup for every man. This is indeed as fair a sight as a man can see. Now, however, since you are inclined to ask the story of my sorrows, and rekindle my own sad memories in respect of them, I do not know how to begin, nor yet how to continue and conclude my tale, for the hand of heaven has been laid heavily upon me.

"Firstly, then, I will tell you my name that you too may know it, and one day, if I outlive this time of sorrow, may become my guests though I live so far away from all of you. I am Ulysses son of Laertes, renowned among mankind for all manner of subtlety, so that my fame ascends to heaven. I live in Ithaca, where there is a high mountain called Neritum, covered with forests; and not far from it there is a group of islands very near to one another—Dulichium, Same, and the wooded island of Zacynthus. It lies squat on the horizon, all highest up in the sea towards the sunset, while the others lie away from it towards dawn. It is a rugged island, but it breeds brave men, and my eyes know none that they better love to look upon. The goddess Calypso kept me with her in her cave, and wanted me to marry her, as did also the cunning Aeaean goddess Circe; but they could neither of them persuade me, for there is nothing dearer to a man than his own country and his parents, and however splendid a home he may have in a foreign country, if it be far from father or mother, he does not care about it. Now, however, I will tell you of the many hazardous adventures which by Jove's will I met with on my return from Troy. When I had set sail thence the wind took me first to Ismarus, which is the city of the Cicons."</p>

Tables loaded down. Bread piled high. Meat stackin' up. And that wine-boy? Drawin' sweet mix from the big bowl, pourin' heavy into them cups, sloshin' it round. Baby — that's the finest. That's what my heart see clearest.

But you — you done turned my mind to these heavy sorrows. Heavy. Got me groanin' even louder now: What first? What last? Y'all, gods up in heaven done dropped woes on me by the boatload.

Now first off, lemme drop my name so y'all know. Know who standin' here. Then, once I slip this cruel day, I'll roll up as a stranger from way far off, makin' myself at home with y'all. I'm Odysseus, Laertes' boy — y'all heard, the one all folks talk 'bout with them slick ways, fame ringin' up to the skies. I stay Ithaca, that clear-wooded spot: Neriton mountain on her, shady leaves, standin' tall. Round her, islands close like family — Dulichium, Same, and Zacynthus thick with trees. Ithaca low-lyin', farthest sea toward the dark west, them others out to dawn and sun, rough-edged — but she raise boys right. Y'all, ain't no land sweeter to these eyes. None.

Calypso, that fine goddess, held me back right then in them deep caves, fiendin' to make me her man. Circe too, tricky in Aeaea halls, same thing. But my heart deep in my chest? Wasn't havin' it. Wasn't. Listen — ain't nothin' sweeter than your own land, your own folks, even if you far off in some rich foreign spot, cut from mama and daddy.

          <p class="passage">Well now, I reckon there ain't a finer thing in this world — not to me — than when joy's runnin' all through the town, folks settin' in rows in the houses listenin' to the singer, tables piled high with bread and meat close by, and the cupbearer drawin' sweet wine from the mixin' bowl, pourin' it out and handin' it round in the cups. I'll tell you what, that's the finest thing I can picture in my mind.

But your mind's turned to askin' my sorrows, so's I can moan and grieve all the deeper, cryin' harder still. What to tell first, what to leave for last? Well, bless his heart, them gods up in heaven laid so many troubles on me. Now first I'll speak my name, so y'all'll know it — now, you might've heard tell — and then once I slip this hard day, I'll be a stranger here among you, come from way off yonder.

I'm Odysseus, son of Laertes — that man folks sing about everywhere for his tricks, and my fame's reached clean to the heavens. I hail from Ithaca, that little clear-weathered island. Right there on her is old Mount Neriton, tree-shaded and pretty as a picture, good for grazin', and round about are islands layin' close together — Dulichium and Same and that wooded Zacynthus. But Ithaca herself sits low, way out furthest in the sea toward the dark of evenin', while them others lie out front toward the dawn and the sun, rough country but good for raisin' boys. Lord, I ain't never laid eyes on no sweeter stretch of ground.

It was Calypso herself held me back right there, that fine-lookin' goddess-woman, in her deep cave holler, wantin' me for her man. Same way with Circe, that sly fox, settin' in her grand house on Aeaea, wantin' me for her man. But they never could turn my heart in my chest. Ain't nothin' sweeter than your own country and your own folks — not even if you're livin' far off in some rich land away from your parents.

Well now, I tell you what, if y'all want my homecomin' tale, full up with troubles — the one the good Lord Zeus handed me comin' back from Troy. The wind from Ilium carried me first to the Cicones —</p>

          <p class="passage">Nothing classier. Whole town happy. Boys in rows around the house, listening to the singer. Tables piled with grub, meat that sticks to your ribs. Cup kid sloshes the sweet stuff from the bowl into glasses. That's the picture that sits right in my head. But you turned my mind to the hard luck. The endless kind. So I groan deeper now. What first? What last? The big shots upstairs dealt me a full hand. Start with the name. So you know it. Then I dodge one more bad day. Show up your guest from the sticks. Name's Ulysses. Laertes' kid. The one all the marks know for angles. My name hits the sky. Ithaca's home. Clear view. Neritum's the mountain. Leafy cliff that drops clean. Islands crowd close: Dulichium, Same, Zacynthus thick with trees. Mine squats low, farthest out toward the dark. The others off to dawn and sunup. Rough country. But raises boys right. Never seen sweeter dirt. Calypso had me pinned then. Goddess type. In her deep cave—the kind that whispers promises. She figured me for husband material. Circe ran the same game in her big house on Aeaea. The tricky one. Wanted me for keeps. Never took. Nothing sweeter than your own dirt and the old folks. Even sitting fat in some rich house far off in foreign parts. Now the trip back. The messy one Jove okayed from Troy. Out of Ilium, the wind dumped me with the Cicones.</p>
