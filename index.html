        <h2>Literal Translation English</h2>
        <p class="meta">Word-level rendering from Greek; readability not optimized.</p>
        <p class="passage">Just as in geographies, O Sossius Senecio, the historians, pressing the things escaping their knowledge into the outermost parts of the maps, write marginal explanations that "the things beyond are waterless and beast-filled sand-dunes," or "trackless mire," or "Scythian cold," or "frozen sea," so also for me, in the writing of the Parallel Lives, after passing through the time reachable by likely reasoning and having a footing in a history clinging to deeds, it was fitting to say about the things further back: "the things beyond, monstrous and tragic, poets and myth-writers pasture, and it no longer has trust nor clarity."</p>
        <p class="passage">But after issuing the discourse about Lycurgus the lawgiver and Numa the king, we thought that not without reason we should climb up toward Romulus, having come near his times with the history; and while I considered, "for such a man (according to Aeschylus) who will be matched? whom shall I set against this one? who is equal?" it appeared right to set and compare against the father of unconquered and great-glorious Rome the founder of fair and much-sung Athens.</p>
        <p class="passage">May it then be for us that the mythical element, being cleansed by reason, should obey and take on the appearance of history; but wherever it stubbornly despises the persuasive and does not accept mixture with the likely, we shall ask for well-disposed hearers, and ones receiving ancient narration gently.</p>

        <h2>Dryden/Clough</h2>
        <p class="meta">1859, via Wikisource</p>
        <p class="passage">As geographers, Sosius Senecio, crowd into the edges of their maps parts of the world which escape their knowledge, adding notes, in the margin, to the effect, that beyond this lie sandy deserts full of wild beasts, unapproachable bogs, Scythian ice, and frozen sea, so, in the chart of my lives, from those periods which probable reasoning can reach to, and where the history of facts can find firm footing, in passing those remote ages which are accessible only to conjecture, I might well say, Beyond this there is nothing but prodigies and fictions, the only inhabitants are the poets and inventors of fables, there is no other certainty, or reality.</p>
        <p class="passage">After I had published my account of Lycurgus the lawgiver and Numa the king, it seemed to me not unreasonable if, now that my history had brought me down to Romulus, I should pass in review and compare with him, as it were, the man who gave Athens its beautiful and famous city.</p>
        <p class="passage">May I therefore succeed in purifying fable, making it submit to reason so as to assume the face of history. Where it cannot be reduced to any probable likeness, and refuses to admit any element of the possible, I shall beg my readers to be indulgent to antiquity in its records.</p>

        <p class="meta">1894, via Project Gutenberg</p>
        <p class="passage">As geographers crowd into the edges of their maps such parts of the world as have never yet been explored, adding notes in the margin, saying, Beyond this there are sandy deserts, where wild beasts dwell, or impassable morasses, or Scythian snows, or frozen seas: so in this work on Parallel Lives, now that we have gone through those periods where probable reasoning can find firm footing in fact, and where history can gain a clear insight, all beyond this is portentous and fabulous, where poets and romancers wander and nothing can be found true or certain.</p>
        <p class="passage">Yet, now that I have published the lives of Lykurgus the lawgiver and Numa the king, as I have brought my narrative down in chronology to Romulus, I thought I might well compare with him who made glorious and famous Athens, the father of unconquerable and glorious Rome.</p>
        <p class="passage">May I be able to purge away the mythical matter, and make it submit to reason and look like history; but where it will not yield to probable argument, and cannot be made to agree with what is possible, I shall ask for indulgent readers, and such as can receive with favour the tales of antiquity.</p>

        <p class="meta">User Preference: This should be readable by a 10 year old.</p>
        <p class="passage">Just like mapmakers, Sosius Senecio, squeeze unknown parts of the world onto the edges of their maps. They add notes saying: "Beyond here are dry sandy deserts full of wild animals," or "endless sticky mud," or "super-cold northern ice," or "frozen sea." That's how it is with my Parallel Lives. After covering times we can reach with smart guesses and real history facts, it would be right to say about the earlier ages: "Beyond that are weird monsters and wild drama that poets and storytellers make up. There's no truth or clear facts anymore."</p>
        <p class="passage">After we finished writing about Lycurgus the rule-maker and King Numa, it seemed okay to add Romulus too. Our history had reached near his time. But as I thought about this shining hero (like Aeschylus says): Who will fight him? Who can I match against him? Who is strong enough? It felt right to compare the founder of pretty, famous Athens with the father of unbeatable, glorious Rome.</p>
        <p class="passage">I hope we can clean up the myths with reason, so they obey and look like real history. But wherever they stubbornly ignore what's believable and refuse to blend in anything likely, we'll ask for kind listeners who gently welcome ancient stories.</p>

        <p class="meta">User Preference: Translation Kernel (Homeric Epic into Modern English, young-adult accessible, tone-preserving).</p>
        <p class="passage">Just as geographers, Sosius Senecio, crowd into the outermost edges of their maps the regions escaping their knowledge, appending notes that 'beyond lie sandy wastes waterless and beast-ridden,' or 'abyssal mire,' or 'Scythian cold,' or 'frozen sea,' so in the writing of the Parallel Lives, having traversed the time accessible to plausible reasoning and grounded in the history of facts, it would be fitting to say of the earlier periods: 'beyond monstrous and tragic things poets and myth-makers pasture, and there is no longer faith nor clarity.'</p>
        <p class="passage">After publishing the account of Lycurgus the lawgiver and Numa the king, we seemed not unreasonably-our history having reached near his times-to prefix Romulus too. But to me pondering such a man (as Aeschylus says)-who will encounter him? whom shall I set against this one? who bears surety?-it appeared right to array the founder of fair and far-famed Athens opposite him, and match him to the father of invincible and glorious Rome.</p>
        <p class="passage">May we then purify the mythical by reason, making it submit and take on history's semblance. But wherever it arrogantly disdains the plausible and refuses the mix with the probable, we shall beg clear-minded hearers who receive antiquity indulgently.</p>
