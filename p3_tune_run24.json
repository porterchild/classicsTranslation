Source-close sketch: May it be ours the mythical purified by reason submitting and taking history's appearance, but wherever arrogantly despising the credible and not receiving mixing toward the likely, we shall beg good-minded hearers and those mildly receiving antiquity. Interpolation/exploration: Test 1 (mild): I hope reason cleans myths so they obey and look like history; where they scorn believability and reject probable mixing, beg indulgent listeners kindly welcoming ancient lore. Too abstract. Test 2 (kid-simple): Use good sense to wash myths clean and make them seem true like history stories. If they stay stubborn and won't blend real possibilities, need nice people who hear old tales gently. Flows better, depersonifies. Test 3 (bolder paraphrase, break syntax): I'll make myths fit reason and turn into history. For parts too wild to believe or mix with real life, please be patient readers of ancient stories. Natural, but check faithfulness - loses 'submit' nuance, keeps core wish/contrast. Test 4 (everyday verbs): Hope to fix myths with logic so they match history's look. Where they ignore what's possible and skip likely blends, ask understanding kids reading to welcome old tales nicely. Conversational. Hard parts: 'purifying mythical with reason' -> 'clean up myths with clear thinking' (concrete process). 'Submit and take history's face' -> 'obey and look like history' -> simplify to 'so they look like history'.
