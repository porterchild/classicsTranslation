[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 1] [sequential] judgment: Strong readability and modernity for a 7yo audience, but faithfulness dips due to singular 'I' shift from source plural 'us/we', forced myth personification, and loose phrasing of key contrasts like 'believable/likely' mix.[0m
[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 1] [sequential] strengths: Smooth plain clauses flow naturally like modern kids' story; everyday words like 'clean up' and 'look like real history' concretely express abstracts; merges optative wish into direct 'hope' without dropping core intent; avoids reference borrowing.[0m
[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 1] [sequential] issues: Singular 'I' ignores source plural ἡμῖν/δεησόμεθα ('for us/we shall beg'); personifies 'a myth' as stubborn actor, calque-like vs source neuter τὸ μυθῶδες; 'clear thinking' too vague for λόγῳ ('reason/argument'); 'ignores what's believable/refuses to blend with anything likely' stacks abstractions indirectly when plain 'won't mix with what's probable' fits; 'listeners' misses modern reader feel for ἀκροατῶν.[0m

[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 2] [sequential] strengths: Smooth plain clauses like 'clean up the myths so they look like true history' turn abstracts into kid-friendly actions; clear contrast via 'But wherever' preserves source opposition; merged 'blend with what's believable and stubbornly skips anything likely' improves flow without dropping core refusal.[0m
[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 2] [sequential] issues: 'I hope' shifts impersonal optative wish ('εἴη...ἡμῖν') to personal statement, losing group plea nuance; 'true history' adds veracity not in 'ἱστορίας ὄψιν' (just 'history's look'); 'skips anything likely' weakens deliberate 'αὐθαδῶς περιφρονῇ καὶ μὴ δέχηται τὴν...μῖξιν' (arrogant scorn and rejection of probable mix); 'patience' dilutes 'πρᾴως προσδεχομένων' (gentle reception) into milder tolerance.[0m
