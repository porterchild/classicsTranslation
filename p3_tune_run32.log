[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 1] [sequential] judgment: Strong readability and modernity for a 7-year-old audience, with smooth plain clauses and everyday terms like 'made-up stories' and 'real history'. Faithfulness is good on core contrast but slips on optative voice, precise terms for λόγῳ and ἀρχαιολογίαν, and slight over-personification.[0m
[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 1] [sequential] strengths: Smooth two-sentence flow with clear 'but' contrast; everyday words like 'clean up', 'stubbornly ignore', 'kind listeners' fit 7yo level without cutesiness; merges clauses naturally without dropping relations; direct outcome phrasing like 'look like real history' rewards intent over stiff figurative.[0m
[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 1] [sequential] issues: Optative wish ('may it be for us') flattened to personal 'I hope to', losing shared 'us' nuance; 'clear thinking' too vague for λόγῳ (reason/argument); 'old tales' casualizes ἀρχαιολογίαν (ancient records/learning) vs references' 'records/tales of antiquity'; mild personification stacks ('they stubbornly ignore... refuse') feels slightly forced vs direct outcome.[0m

[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 2] [sequential] judgment: Solid progress toward 7yo readability with smooth flow and plain structure, but faithfulness slightly bends with 'true history' addition, and abstract terms like 'believable' and 'likely' need everyday swaps to fully hit user preference.[0m
[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 2] [sequential] strengths: Breaks into two smooth plain clauses matching source contrast; uses everyday verbs like 'clean up' and 'look like' for purification and 'face of history'; merges 'submit and take' into natural 'so they look like' without dropping intent; patient reception rendered as 'patiently welcome' in direct modern phrasing.[0m
[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 2] [sequential] issues: 'True history' adds unsubtle emphasis not in source 'ἱστορίας ὄψιν' (just 'history's appearance'); 'what's believable' and 'anything likely' stack mild abstractions above 7yo level vs. source's 'πιθανόν'/'εἰκὸς' (credible/probable) which need plainer 'makes sense'/'possible'; 'blend in' feels slightly cutesy-casual when plain 'mix with' preserves dignified tone; 'listeners' fits 'ἀκροατῶν' but 'stories' softens precise 'ἀρχαιολογίαν' (ancient inquiry) toward tales per references.[0m

[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 3] [sequential] judgment: Excellent readability for a 7-year-old with smooth plain clauses and everyday words; strong modernity and flow, but faithfulness dips slightly from rephrasing the source's impersonal wish ('may it be for us') as active 'I hope we can,' softening the purifying process and audience descriptors.[0m
[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 3] [sequential] strengths: Uses simple verbs like 'clean up' and 'look like' for abstract ἐκκαθαιρόμενον and ὄψιν; 'stubbornly refuse' captures αὐθαδῶς well; merges clauses smoothly without dropping contrast; 'old tales of long ago' concretely simplifies ἀρχαιολογίαν for kids while fitting context.[0m
[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 3] [sequential] issues: 'I hope we can use clear thinking' shifts source's passive optative wish (εἴη... ἐκκαθαιρόμενον... ὑπακοῦσαι) to active first-person effort, losing the prayer-like tone; 'things that make sense' and 'anything possible' vaguely paraphrase πιθανόν/εἰκός without sharp plausible/likely distinction; 'kind people who patiently accept' softens εὐγνωμόνων/πρᾴως to generic kindness, missing 'sensible/mild' judgment.[0m

[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 4] [sequential] strengths: Uses short plain clauses like 'clean up myths so they look like history' that a 7yo grasps instantly; captures key contrast with 'But wherever' without dropping relations; everyday terms like 'stubbornly ignore what's believable' express abstracts simply; flows like modern kids' nonfiction.[0m
[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 4] [sequential] issues: 'May we use clear thinking to clean up' feels slightly indirect for the optative wish (εἴη... ἐκκαθαιρόμενον) and could be plainer as a hoped-for action; 'refuse to blend in anything likely' is a tad clunky for 7yo flow, echoing Greek μῖξιν too literally instead of direct outcome like 'won't mix with anything probable'; 'sensible listeners' is plain but borders bookish next to 'kindly accept'; 'old stories' softens ἀρχαιολογίαν safely but could nod to 'ancient records' without losing kid-friendliness.[0m
