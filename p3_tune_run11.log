[96m[paragraph 1] [iter 1] [sequential] observations: Simple restate: I hope to clean myths with reason so they look like history; but if they stubbornly reject believability and won't mix with likely things, ask for kind patient readers of old tales. Hard parts: 'purifying fable by reason to submit and take history's face' - options: 'clean myths with reason so they obey and look real' / 'make pretend stories reasonable like true history' / 'scrub fairy tales to seem historical'; kid-natural: 'use clear thinking to fix make-believe parts into real-sounding history'. 'Stubbornly scorns plausible/refuses mix with likely' - options: 'ignores what's believable/won't blend with possible' / 'won't sound real or mix with what could happen'; test: 'stays too wild and won't fit real life'. Bolder paraphrase breaking syntax: 'I want pretend stories to become true history through reason. If some won't act believable, please be nice and accept old tales patiently.' Interpolation: From simple ('fix myths to look real') to source-close ('mythical submitting by reason to history's look') -> 'make mythical parts obey reason and look like history'. Personification dropped for plain 'story won't...'; everyday verbs like 'mix/blend' over 'submit'. Final picks clearest natural flow preserving all relations.[0m

[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 1] [sequential] judgment: Strong on readability and modernity for a 7-year-old audience with smooth, plain clauses and natural plausibility terms; faithfulness is solid but dips slightly from first-person shift and interpretive active phrasing that depersonifies the source's wished-for process on the myths themselves.[0m
[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 1] [sequential] strengths: Excellent flow with short, smooth clauses; kid-friendly words like 'make-believe,' 'clear thinking,' 'believable,' 'could really happen' match user preference perfectly; natural English prose avoids translationese, feels like modern storybook; preserves core contrast between purifying myths vs. needing indulgent readers.[0m
[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 1] [sequential] issues: First-person 'I hope to clean up... so they obey it' shifts source's impersonal optative wish (εἴη... ἡμῖν ἐκκαθαιρόμενον... ὑπακοῦσαι) for 'us' into active speaker action, losing passive process on myths; 'a story stubbornly ignores' keeps mild personification but could depersonify further for natural kid prose; 'kind listeners who patiently welcome' slightly softens 'sensibly indulgent receivers of antiquity' (εὐγνωμόνων... πρᾴως προσδεχομένων τὴν ἀρχαιολογίαν); no cutesy/slangy looseness, but 'obey it' chain feels vaguely meta.[0m

Hard parts: Optative wish εἴη...ἐκκαθαιρόμενον (passive process for 'us') – options: 'May it be ours that make-believe gets cleaned by clear thinking, so it follows and looks like history'; 'I wish the pretend parts would get scrubbed clean by reason to obey and seem real'; interpolate source-close 'May the mythical yield to reason's purifying, taking history's face' to kid-plain 'Hope pretend stories clean up with thinking to look true'. Personification (ὑπακοῦσαι, περιφρονῇ, δέχηται): depersonify to 'so they follow it' / 'where it skips believable and won't blend with real-possible'. Contrast ὅπου...αὐθαδῶς: 'But wherever it boldly scorns plausible and rejects mix with likely' → 'But if it stubbornly skips what's believable or could happen'.

[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 2] [sequential] judgment: Strong readability for a 7-year-old with smooth, plain clauses and natural plausibility terms like 'could really happen'; preserves core wish-contrast structure faithfully but weakens arrogant disdain to mild 'skips' and softens pleading to casual 'need', risking some tone loss; mostly natural modern prose without Greek mirroring.[0m
[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 2] [sequential] strengths: Excellent kid-friendly simplicity ('make-believe parts', 'clear thinking', 'real history', 'could really happen'); flows in short plain clauses; depersonifies slightly for naturalness while keeping conditional contrast; rewards merged phrasing like 'look like real history' for readability without dropping relations.[0m
[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 2] [sequential] issues: 'Stubbornly skips what's believable' clunky and too light/casual for αὐθαδῶς περιφρονῇ (arrogantly disdains/scorns plausible)—feels evasive vs. defiant scorn; rewrite to 'stubbornly ignores what sounds believable'. 'I wish the make-believe parts could get cleaned up... so they follow it' vague pronoun chain ('it' = reason?) and passive wish softens optative agency—sounds slightly analytical; 'we'll need kind listeners' downplays δεησόμεθα (beg/pray for indulgent hearers) to flat necessity, losing humble plea; 'listeners' ok but source hearers imply oral, modernize to 'readers' per refs if fitting; minor personification in 'it stubbornly skips' feels source-shaped/stiff for kids—depersonify to process.[0m

Source-close: 'May purifying-mythical-by-reason obey/take-history-face happen-for-us; but wherever arrogantly-scorns-plausible and rejects-toward-likely-mixture, we'll-beg goodminded-hearers mildly-receiving ancient-study.' Interpolation: Blend wish ('hope reason cleans myths to look historical') with condition ('where myth scorns believable, no probable mix'); hard parts—αὐθαδῶς περιφρονῇ: test 'stubbornly scorns/ignores/disdaings what sounds believable' (scorns too adult, ignores milder but evasive; 'stubbornly acts like believable stuff doesn't matter' clunky); μὴ δέχηται τὴν πρὸς τὸ εἰκὸς μῖξιν: 'refuses/won't mix/blend with what could happen for real' (blend natural); δεησόμεθα: 'we'll beg/plead/ask for indulgent hearers' (beg keeps humble plea over 'need'); ἀρχαιολογίαν: 'ancient tales/stories/old records' (stories kid-friendly). Alternatives: Personified 'if the myth stubbornly snubs believable parts' stiff—depersonify to 'where it won't include believable bits'; bolder paraphrase breaking syntax: 'Let's use reason to make myths seem true like history. If some parts stay unbelievable no matter what, please be kind readers and enjoy the old stories anyway.' (natural flow, direct plea, but softens contrast/arrogance—keep conditional for faithfulness). Stiff test: 'I wish myth submits to reason's cleaning for history's look' too abstract—rewrite 'I hope to scrub myths clean with reason till they match history.' Best: Merge for clauses 'I hope clear thinking cleans the make-believe for us so it obeys reason and looks like real history. But where it stubbornly scorns what sounds believable and won't mix with real-possible stuff, we'll beg kind readers who welcome old tales gently.'
