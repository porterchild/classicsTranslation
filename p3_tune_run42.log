But if some stubbornly won't make sense or blend with what's likely, we'll need kind folks who patiently accept old tales. b) Source-close sketch: May it be ours: the mythical, purifying by reason, obey and take history's appearance; but wherever arrogantly it scorns plausible and rejects mix with likely, we beg good-judging hearers and those mildly receiving ancient inquiry. c) Candidates: 1. Use reason to purify myths into history's look; for stubborn refusals of probability, seek indulgent ancient-story fans. 2. Clean myths with logic to seem true history—but unmixable parts need patient, kind readers for old records. 3. Break syntax: Myths obey reason, become history. Stubborn ones? Hope nice people forgive ancient tales.[0m

[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 1] [sequential] judgment: Solid first pass with excellent readability for a young audience, but faithfulness dips due to voice shift from impersonal wish to personal 'I hope', loose rendering of key terms, and softened plea from 'beg' to 'need'. Modernity shines, but some phrasing risks abstraction for 7yo level.[0m
[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 1] [sequential] strengths: Smooth plain clauses flow naturally like modern storytelling; everyday words like 'clean up', 'stubbornly ignore', 'blend' make abstracts concrete and kid-friendly; merges complex Greek structure into two easy sentences without dropping contrast; direct outcome phrasing avoids stiff personification carryover.[0m
[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 1] [sequential] issues: Shifts source's impersonal optative wish ('may it be for us') to personal 'I hope', losing communal tone; treats abstract 'τὸ μυθῶδες' (the mythical) as plural 'stories' with agency, adding unneeded concreteness; 'clear thinking' dilutes precise 'λόγῳ' (reason/logos); 'need' weakens urgent 'δεησόμεθα' (beg/implore); 'old tales' casualizes 'ἀρχαιολογίαν' (ancient inquiry/history); synonyms 'believable/likely' repeat without unifying for simplicity.[0m
[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 1] [sequential] revision plan: Reword first sentence to 'May we use reason to purify myths until they follow it and look like history' for wish faithfulness and plainness; unify 'believable/likely' to single 'possible' pair; change 'we will need' to 'we'll ask for kind listeners who gently accept ancient stories'; drop plural 'stories' to singular 'myth' for abstract match; replace 'clean up' with 'purify' or 'wash clean' if plainer; test full: 'May we purify myth with reason so it obeys and looks like history. But where it stubbornly scorns what's possible and rejects mixing with likelihoods, we'll beg kind hearers who mildly welcome ancient lore.' Simplify further for 7yo: swap 'scorns/rejects/mixing' to 'ignores/won't join'.[0m
