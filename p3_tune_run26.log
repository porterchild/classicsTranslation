[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 1] [sequential] judgment: Solid first pass with natural flow and preserved contrast, but faithfulness dips from plural 'we/us' to singular 'I' and abstractions like 'mythical parts' and 'believable' exceed 7yo everyday level, needing plainer swaps for core wishfulness.[0m
[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 1] [sequential] strengths: Smooth plain clauses split the conditional contrast cleanly; 'blend with what's likely' merges μῖξιν naturally without loss; modern post-like rhythm avoids Greek structure mirroring.[0m
[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 1] [sequential] issues: Shifts source plural ἡμῖν/δεησόμεθα ('us/we shall beg') to singular 'I hope/will ask', losing shared plea; 'mythical parts' and 'clear thinking' abstract—use kid-level 'make-believe stories' and 'good sense'; 'stubbornly ignore what's believable' stacks words above 7yo (e.g., 'believable' not plain); 'true history' adds unfaithful emphasis.[0m
[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 1] [sequential] revision plan: Revise to: 'I wish we could clean the make-believe stories with good sense, so they obey and look like real history. But where they won't mix in anything that makes sense, we'll ask for kind listeners who gently accept the old tales.' This restores plural, swaps 'mythical/clear thinking/believable/likely' to 'make-believe/good sense/makes sense', drops 'stubbornly ignore/refuse to blend' to tighter 'won't mix in', keeps 'look like real history' plainer than 'true'.[0m

'Good sense to scrub myths till they look historical; stubborn ones get a pass from patient readers.' (syntax break, punchy modern); 2. 'We wish to blend myth with reason into history's shape, begging kind ears where likelihood fails.'; 3. 'Clean pretend tales with clear heads to seem true—else need gentle folks for ancient yarns.' Prior fixes: Restore 'we/us' plural (ἡμῖν/δεησόμεθα); swap to 'make-believe stories/good sense/makes sense/real history/old tales'; tighten contrast without stacking adverbs.[0m

[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 2] [sequential] judgment: Strong simplification for a 7-year-old audience with good flow and modern feel, but minor faithfulness lapses in phrasing the purification process and vague second clause weaken precision without dropping core contrast.[0m
[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 2] [sequential] strengths: Uses everyday words like 'make-believe stories', 'good sense', and 'mix in anything that makes sense' to concretize abstracts; smooth two-sentence structure with plain clauses flows naturally; preserves wish-contrast dynamic without calques.[0m
[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 2] [sequential] issues: First sentence shifts agency to 'we clean' instead of mythical element being purified/submitting, diluting source's passive optative; 'won't mix in anything that makes sense' blurs 'stubbornly despises probable + refuses mixture with likely'; 'listeners' fits source but 'old tales' softens 'ancient records/inquiry' too cutely vs dignified plainness; minor repetition in 'makes sense' echoes awkwardly.[0m
[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 2] [sequential] revision plan: Rewrite first sentence to: 'May the make-believe parts get cleaned by clear thinking, so they follow it and look like true history.'; Second: 'But where they stubbornly skip anything likely and won't blend with what could happen, we'll ask kind listeners to gently accept the old stories.'; Merge 'obey and look like' into 'follow it and look like' for tighter flow; swap 'gently welcome' to 'gently accept' for plainer dignity.[0m

'May myths submit to reason and wear history's face; where they spurn probability's blend, indulgent hearers for antiquity.' (syntax-parallel); 2. 'Clean pretend parts with logic to seem factual; if too stubborn for sense, hope nice folks accept old lore.' (breaks syntax, active/subject swap); 3. 'Wish: reason washes fable into history-look.

[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 3] [sequential] judgment: Solid simplification for kids but slips into mildly bookish words like 'scorn' and abstract 'believable/likely' that a 7yo might stumble on; pronoun ambiguity and mild personification dilute plainness without adding flow.[0m

[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 3] [sequential] issues: 'Scorn' is bookish/not plain (kids say 'ignore' or 'won't go along'); 'believable' and 'likely' stack abstractions—use 'makes sense'; 'it' in 'follow it' unclear (thinking or history?); forced 'they stubbornly...refuse' personifies awkwardly vs source's direct disdain/refusal.[0m

[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 4] [sequential] judgment: Strong readability for a 7-year-old with smooth flow and everyday words, but faithfulness dips from loose personification of 'make-believe parts' and vague pronouns that obscure the source's contrast between myth/reason and myth/probability.[0m
[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 4] [sequential] strengths: Uses plain clauses like 'clean the make-believe parts' and 'look like real history' to make abstracts concrete; maintains core wish-contrast structure without dropping relations; natural modern phrasing like 'stubbornly ignore' and 'gently welcome' flows like a kids' storybook.[0m
[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 4] [sequential] issues: Personifies 'make-believe parts' as 'they' who 'obey/mix/ignore/refuse,' forcing abstraction where source treats myth as a unified element submitting or scorning; unclear pronouns ('it' jumps from 'clear thinking' to 'what makes sense'); 'clear thinking' still mildly abstract for 7yo vs. plainer 'reason' or 'logic'; 'what makes sense' blurs distinct πιθανοῦ (plausible) and εἰκὸς (likely) into one vague term, softening contrast.[0m

This drops forced 'they' plural/personification, clarifies with 'fairy-tale stuff'/'believable things'/'what's likely' for 7yo plainness, uses 'I hope'/'beg' for natural optative/deprecatory verbs, and merges 'old tales' to 'old stories' for dignity without cutesiness.[0m
