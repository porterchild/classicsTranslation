But if some won't act believable or blend with what's likely, I'll need kind listeners who patiently welcome old tales. b) Source-close sketch: May it be for us the mythical purified by reason submitting and taking history's appearance, but wherever arrogantly scorning the plausible and not accepting mixture with the likely, we shall beg good-minded hearers and those mildly receiving the ancient inquiry. c) Candidates: 1. Clean myths by reason to obey and wear history's face; if stubborn against probable mix, seek kind gentle receivers of antiquity. 2. (Breaks syntax) Make myths real with logic. Need nice folks for unbelievable old stuff. 3. Hope reason tames myths into history-look; beg patience where they won't blend believably.[0m

[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 1] [sequential] judgment: Solid first pass: captures core wish-contrast structure faithfully in plain terms, flows smoothly for young readers, but minor abstractions and vague referents slightly hinder 7yo clarity without dropping meaning.[0m
[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 1] [sequential] strengths: Uses everyday verbs like 'clean up', 'obey', 'blend' to convey purification and submission directly; splits into two smooth clauses matching source contrast; 'kind listeners who gently welcome' nails indulgent reception in simple dignified tone.[0m
[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 1] [sequential] issues: 'Mythical parts' and 'some' create unclear referents (what is 'some'?); 'clear thinking' abstracts λόγῳ better as plain 'reason'; 'ignore what's believable' and 'blend with what's likely' stack mild abstractions when direct outcomes like 'sound real' fit 7yo level; 'listeners' faithful to ἀκροατῶν but contextually readers, risks confusion; 'old tales' softens ἀρχαιολογίαν slightly vs precise 'ancient stories'.[0m
