**Known translation (Samuel Butler (1900)):**
> “Then, when we had got down to the sea shore we drew our ship into the water and got her mast and sails into her; we also put the sheep on board and took our places, weeping and in great distress of mind. Circe, that great and cunning goddess, sent us a fair wind that blew dead aft and staid steadily with us keeping our sails all the time well filled; so we did whatever wanted doing to the ship’s gear and let her go as the wind and helmsman headed her. All day long her sails were full as she held her course over the sea, but when the sun went down and darkness was over all the earth, we got into the deep waters of the river Oceanus, where lie the land and city of the Cimmerians who live enshrouded in mist and darkness which the rays of the sun never pierce neither at his rising nor as he goes down again out of the heavens, but the poor wretches live in one long melancholy night. When we got there we beached the ship, took the sheep out of her, and went along by the waters of Oceanus till we came to the place of which Circe had told us.

**Pipeline output:**
> We went on grieving and in tears. Behind us Circe sent a fair wind from the ship right astern to speed our good comrade on his way—a dread goddess skilled in magic. We stowed our arms about the ship and sat down, while wind and steersman kept her on her course. All day her sails were filled as she sped over the sea; the sun went down, and everywhere grew dark. She reached the bounds of Ocean stream. There lay the country and city of the Cimmerians, wrapped in mist and cloud. The sun never looks on them with his rays, neither when he climbs to the starry heaven nor when he turns back from heaven to earth, but deadly night is spread forever over these wretched people. When we came there we beached the ship and took out the sheep. We walked along by Ocean stream till we reached the place of which Circe had told us. There Perimedes and Eurylochus held the victims, while I drew my sword from beside my thigh and dug a pit about a foot each way. Round it I poured a drink-offering to all the dead—first milk and honey, then sweet wine, thirdly water, and last sprinkled white barley meal. I offered many prayers to the poor dead, vowing that when I got to Ithaca I would sacrifice in my halls my best cow and burn a pile of rich gifts on her pyre; moreover, to Tiresias alone, apart from all the rest, I would offer a black ram, the pick of all my flocks. When with my prayers and vows I had thus entreated the nations of the dead,

**Rationale:** The pipeline output captures Butler's brisk, readable Victorian prose with medium-length active-voice sentences, compound structures using 'and,' 'but,' and 'moreover,' and selective epithets like 'dread goddess skilled in magic.' It maintains a matter-of-fact tone for supernatural elements and natural dialogue flow in the narrative. Minor phrasing awkwardness ('fair wind from the ship right astern') and 'Ocean stream' instead of 'Oceanus' prevent a perfect match.

**Key gaps:** Uses 'Ocean stream' rather than Butler's 'Oceanus' or 'river Oceanus'; Slightly clunky phrasing like 'fair wind from the ship right astern to speed our good comrade' vs. Butler's smoother 'fair wind that blew dead aft'; Starts abruptly without the ship-launching details in the ground truth excerpt
**Key matches:** Clear SVO syntax with no archaisms or inversions; Victorian connectives like 'moreover' and lists ('first... then... thirdly...'); Selective epithets and naturalistic god treatment; Brisk rhythm with medium sentences and vivid but simplified descriptions (e.g., Cimmerians' endless night)

**Known translation (Samuel Butler (1900)):**
> At that moment he was thinking of Aegisthus, who had been killed by Agamemnon’s son Orestes; so he said to the other gods:

“See now, how men lay blame upon us gods for what is after all nothing but their own folly. Look at Aegisthus; he must needs make love to Agamemnon’s wife unrighteously and then kill Agamemnon, though he knew it would be the death of him; for I sent Mercury to warn him not to do either of these things, inasmuch as Orestes would be sure to take his revenge when he grew up and wanted to return home. Mercury told him this in all good will but he would not listen, and now he has paid for everything in full.”

**Pipeline output:**
> Orestes son of Agamemnon killed him. Then Jove, who had called him to mind, said to the immortal gods: 'Dear me, how mortals always blame the gods. They say that from us alone come their miseries, but they themselves suffer woes beyond their due through their own follies — as now Aegisthus has done, in marrying the wedded wife of Agamemnon son of Atreus and killing him when he came home, though he knew it meant utter ruin for himself. For we warned him ourselves beforehand by sending Mercury, telling him neither to kill the man nor to woo his wife. Vengeance from Orestes son of Agamemnon would come when he reached manhood and longed for his own country. Mercury said this, but he could not turn Aegisthus from his purpose for all his good advice; and now he has paid for everything all at once.' 'Father, son of Saturn, king of kings, it served him right, and so it would any one else who does as he did; but he is neither here nor there; it is for Ulysses that my heart bleeds, poor man, far from his friends, who suffers in that lonely sea-girt island where lies the navel of the sea. It is a wooded island, and a goddess dwells there, daughter of Atlas who knows the depths of all the sea and himself holds the tall pillars that keep earth and heaven apart. His daughter keeps the unhappy man captive, and always with soft wheedling words beguiles him so that he may forget Ithaca; but Ulysses longs even to see the smoke curl up from his own land, and pines to die. Not even to you...'

**Rationale:** The pipeline output captures Butler's clear, brisk Victorian prose, Latin names (Jove, Mercury, Ulysses), zero archaisms, natural dialogue, and selective epithets, with medium sentences and active voice that read efficiently. It closely mirrors sample passages like Minerva's speech and handles gods naturalistically. Minor deviations include an abrupt opening, slight rephrasing of Jove's speech (e.g., 'we warned' vs. 'I sent'; 'Dear me' vs. 'See now'), and inclusion of extra text beyond the ground truth passage.

**Key gaps:** Abrupt narrative start ('Orestes son of Agamemnon killed him') lacks Butler's smooth transitional phrasing; Jove's speech alters details like 'we warned ourselves' (plural) vs. Butler's 'I sent' (singular), and 'woes beyond their due' vs. 'nothing but their own folly'; 'Immortal gods' vs. Butler's plainer 'other gods'; Appends extended text (Minerva's full speech and Calypso description) not in the specified ground truth passage
**Key matches:** Exact match to Butler's sample for Minerva's speech ('Father, son of Saturn...'); Latin names used consistently (Jove, Mercury, Ulysses); Natural Victorian dialogue tone ('Dear me', 'poor man') and brisk compounds ('but they themselves suffer...'); Zero archaisms, standard SVO, active voice, and understated divine elements

> Tell me, O Muse, of that ingenious hero who travelled far and wide
after he had sacked the famous town of Troy. Many cities did he visit,
and many were the nations with whose manners and customs he was
acquainted; moreover he suffered much by sea while trying to save his
own life and bring his men safely home; but do what he might he could
not save his men, for they perished through their own sheer folly in
eating the cattle of the Sun-god Hyperion; so the god prevented them
from ever reaching home. Tell me, too, about all these things, oh
daughter of Jove, from whatsoever source you may know them.

So now all who escaped death in battle or by shipwreck had got safely
home except Ulysses, and he, though he was longing to return to his
wife and country, was detained by the goddess Calypso, who had got him
into a large cave and wanted to marry him. But as years went by, there
came a time when the gods settled that he should go back to Ithaca;
even then, however, when he was among his own people, his troubles were
not yet over; nevertheless all the gods had now begun to pity him
except Neptune, who still persecuted him without ceasing and would not
let him get home.

**Pipeline output:**
> but do what he might he could not save his men, for they perished through their own sheer folly in eating the cattle of the Sun-god Hyperion; so the god prevented them from ever reaching home. Tell me of these things too, goddess, daughter of Jove. All the others who had escaped sheer destruction were now at home, safe from both war and sea, but he alone, longing for his homecoming and his wife, was kept back by the fair nymph Calypso, queen among goddesses, in her hollow caves, for she wished him to be her husband. But when now the year had come in the revolution of the years wherein the gods appointed that he should return to Ithaca, even then he was not quit of woes, nor among his own folk. All the gods pitied him, except Neptune, who kept on implacably raging against noble Ulysses till he should reach his own land. Meanwhile he had gone to the Aethiopians afar off, the Aethiopians who are divided into two, remotest of men, some where Hyperion sets and some where he rises.

**Rationale:** The pipeline output captures Butler's brisk, accessible prose register with medium-length sentences, active voice, standard syntax, and Latin names like Jove, Neptune, and Ulysses. It matches exactly on key phrases like 'but do what he might...' and maintains a matter-of-fact tone without archaisms or inversions. However, it introduces unnecessary epithets ('fair nymph Calypso, queen among goddesses', 'noble Ulysses') and slightly more poetic phrasing ('revolution of the years wherein', 'quit of woes'), diverging from Butler's selective epithet use and plain Victorian simplicity.

**Key gaps:** Excess epithets like 'fair nymph Calypso, queen among goddesses' and 'noble Ulysses', which Butler drops or simplifies; More literal/poetic constructions like 'revolution of the years wherein' and 'quit of woes', less brisk than Butler's 'as years went by' or 'troubles were not yet over'; Details like 'hollow caves' instead of Butler's prosaic 'large cave'; Includes extraneous Aethiopians material beyond the ground truth scope
**Key matches:** Exact reproduction of Butler's phrasing in 'but do what he might he could not save his men... Sun-god Hyperion'; Consistent use of Latin names (Jove, Neptune, Ulysses, Calypso); Medium sentences with 'but', 'for', 'nor' connectives in active voice; Naturalistic treatment of gods and events, e.g., 'kept back by... Calypso'

> Thus he spoke, and Mercury, guide and guardian, slayer of Argus, did as he was told. Forthwith he bound on his glittering golden sandals with which he could fly like the wind over land and sea. He took the wand with which he seals men’s eyes in sleep or wakes them just as he pleases, and flew holding it in his hand over Pieria; then he swooped down through the firmament till he reached the level of the sea, whose waves he skimmed like a cormorant that flies fishing every hole and corner of the ocean, and drenching its thick plumage in the spray. He flew and flew over many a weary wave, but when at last he got to the island which was his journey’s end, he left the sea and went on by land till he came to the cave where the nymph Calypso lived.

**Pipeline output:**
> even if he came back maimed, having drawn his share from the host; for such is his destiny, to see his friends and reach his high-roofed home and his own native land. So he spoke, and Mercury the messenger did not disobey. Forthwith he bound on his glittering golden sandals with which he could fly like the wind over land and sea. He took the wand with which he seals men's eyes in sleep or wakes them just as he pleases, and flew holding it in his hand over Pieria; then he swooped down through the firmament till he reached the level of the sea, whose waves he skimmed like a cormorant that flies fishing every hole and corner of the ocean, and drenching its thick plumage in the spray. In the same way Mercury sped over the waves. But when he reached the distant island, he stepped from the sea onto the shore and went on till he came to the great cave where the nymph dwelt; and he found her within. A great fire was burning on the hearth, and the savour of burning cedar and thyme came over the island. She sat there singing at her loom as she plied the golden shuttle. Round the cave grew tall trees, alder and poplar and fragrant cypress. There roosted long-winged birds, owls and hawks and long-tongued sea-crows whose business is in the waters. By the cave mouth there stretched a garden vine in full bearing, burgeoned with clusters; and four springs close together ran with clear water, each turned a different way. Soft meadows of violets and parsley bloomed around. Even an immortal who came there would marvel at the sight and delight his heart. There Mercury stood and looked about him. But when he had taken note of everything in his mind, he went straight into the wide cave. Calypso knew him at once when she saw him, for the gods do not fail to recognize one another.

**Rationale:** The pipeline output captures Butler's brisk, accessible Victorian prose almost verbatim in the core flight sequence (sandals, wand, Pieria, cormorant simile) and cave description, with medium sentences, active voice, selective epithets, and naturalistic divine portrayal. Minor paraphrasing in Mercury's epithets ('the messenger' vs. 'guide and guardian, slayer of Argus') and island arrival ('sped over the waves' vs. 'flew and flew over many a weary wave') prevents a perfect match but stays true to readability over fidelity. The preceding destiny lines and extended description align closely with Butler's efficient, non-archaic style.

**Key gaps:** Simplified Mercury's epithets, dropping 'guide and guardian, slayer of Argus'; Paraphrased repetitive flight ('In the same way Mercury sped' vs. 'flew and flew over many a weary wave'); Slightly altered arrival phrasing and delayed naming of Calypso in cave intro
**Key matches:** Verbatim on key descriptive passages (golden sandals, wand, cormorant simile, cave interior with fire, trees, birds, garden); Zero archaism, standard SVO syntax, modern verbs ('did not disobey'); Brisk compounds with 'and/but/for', vivid but selective epithets ('long-winged birds'); Naturalistic god actions and explanatory clauses ('Even an immortal who came there would marvel')

> And now, as Dawn rose from her couch beside Tithonus—harbinger of light alike to mortals and immortals—the gods met in council and with them, Jove the lord of thunder, who is their king. Thereon Minerva began to tell them of the many sufferings of Ulysses, for she pitied him away there in the house of the nymph Calypso.

“Father Jove,” said she, “and all you other gods that live in everlasting bliss, I hope there may never be such a thing as a kind and well-disposed ruler any more, nor one who will govern equitably. I hope they will be all henceforth cruel and unjust, for there is not one of his subjects but has forgotten Ulysses, who ruled them as though he were their father. There he is, lying in great pain in an island where dwells the nymph Calypso, who will not let him go; and he cannot get back to his own country, for he can find neither ships nor sailors to take him over the sea.

> Minerva now told them of Ulysses' many troubles, for he was still suffering in Calypso's house. "Father Jove, and all you other immortal gods, let no sceptred king be kind and gentle any more, or know right from wrong; let him always be harsh and do cruel things; for no one remembers Ulysses, who ruled his people like a gentle father. He lies on an island suffering great hardships there, kept by her against his will. He cannot make his way to his own country, for he has no ships or companions to take him over the sea. Now they are bent on killing his dear son as he comes home; he has gone to Pylos and Lacedaemon to get news of his father." Then Jove answered her: "My child, what words have escaped your lips? You did not plan this yourself, did you—that Ulysses should pay them out when he comes home? Send Telemachus back with all care, for you can do it, so that he may reach his own country quite safely, and the suitors shall take ship and go their ways again." So he spoke, and addressed Mercury his dear son: "Mercury, you are the messenger for other matters too,"

**Rationale:** The pipeline output captures Butler's brisk, clear prose, active voice, medium sentences, and natural Victorian dialogue with correct Latin names and no archaisms. It matches the selective epithet use and understated divine treatment closely. Minor deviations include omitting the 'Dawn rose from her couch beside Tithonus' introduction (a vivid epithet Butler retains) and slightly flattening Minerva's ironic 'I hope' into a direct imperative, making it less nuanced.

**Key gaps:** Omits the selective epithet-expanded Dawn introduction present in Butler; Rephrases Minerva's dialogue from ironic hope ('I hope there may never be') to direct command, reducing subtle irony; Drops 'nymph' for Calypso and simplifies 'pitied him away there' to 'still suffering'
**Key matches:** Correct Latin names (Ulysses, Minerva, Jove, Mercury, Calypso, Telemachus) throughout; Natural, brisk dialogue like Victorian conversation with standard syntax and no inversions; Medium-length active sentences compounded by 'for' and 'and'; Extends into Jove's response in exact Butlerian tone ('what words have escaped your lips?')

> The saffron morn, with early blushes spread,
Now rose refulgent from Tithonus’ bed;
With new-born day to gladden mortal sight,
And gild the courts of heaven with sacred light.
Then met the eternal synod of the sky,
Before the god, who thunders from on high,
Supreme in might, sublime in majesty.
Pallas, to these, deplores the unequal fates
Of wise Ulysses and his toils relates:
Her hero’s danger touch’d the pitying power,
The nymph’s seducements, and the magic bower.
Thus she began her plaint: “Immortal Jove!
And you who fill the blissful seats above!
Let kings no more with gentle mercy sway,
Or bless a people willing to obey,
But crush the nations with an iron rod,
And every monarch be the scourge of God.
If from your thoughts Ulysses you remove,
Who ruled his subjects with a father’s love,
Sole in an isle, encircled by the main,
Abandon’d, banish’d from his native reign,
Unbless’d he sighs, detained by lawless charms,
And press’d unwilling in Calypso’s arms.
Nor friends are there, nor vessels to convey,
Nor oars to cut the immeasurable way.
And now fierce traitors, studious to destroy
His only son, their ambush’d fraud employ;

> To them spake grey-eyed Athene, calling to mind many woes of Odysseus: for sore at heart was he in the halls of the nymph. Father Zeus, and all ye other blessed gods that be for ever, let no sceptre-bearing king be henceforth gracious and mild, nor let him know just things in his heart, but let him be ever harsh and work deeds of violence: seeing that none bethinketh him of divine Odysseus, of the folk over whom he was lord, and was gentle unto them even as a father. Howbeit he lieth on an isle, bearing sore pains in the wide halls of Calypso the nymph, who holdeth him there of necessity; and he may not win unto his own country: for he hath not well-benched ships, nor comrades, to bear him over the broad back of the sea. Lo, now again are they purposed to slay his dear son on his homeward way: and he is gone to goodly Pylos and to glorious Lacedaemon, to hear tidings of his father. And cloud-gathering Zeus answered her and spake: Daughter mine, what word hath escaped the barrier of thy teeth? Nay, verily, thou thyself hast not devised this counsel, how that Odysseus shall take vengeance on them when he cometh. But do thou send Telemachus home skilfully, for thou canst, that he may come to his own country all unscathed; and let the wooers return in a ship. So spake he, and hailed Hermes his dear son: Hermes, for thou verily art a herald in all other things.

**Rationale:** The pipeline output faithfully captures Butcher & Lang's archaic prose register, with consistent use of Greek names, full epithets like 'grey-eyed Athene' and 'cloud-gathering Zeus', paratactic chaining of clauses, and liberal deployment of particles such as 'Howbeit', 'Lo', and 'Nay, verily'. Archaic verbs ('spake', 'lieth', 'bethinketh') and vocabulary ('sore at heart') mirror the KJV-like diction perfectly, and divine actions are narrated with solemn flatness. Minor deviations in phrasing prevent a perfect 10, but it could easily be mistaken for their work.

**Key gaps:** Slightly less incantatory rhythm in some sentences compared to samples' loose dactylic flow; No exact verbatim repetition of formulas, though none are tested here
**Key matches:** Preservation of all epithets and Greek names without variation; Paratactic structure with 'and', 'for', 'seeing that'; Archaic particles and verbs throughout: 'sore', 'Howbeit', 'spake', 'lieth'; Elevated, formal tone effacing translator voice

> She said: the sandals of celestial mould,
Fledged with ambrosial plumes, and rich with gold,
Surround her feet: with these sublime she sails
The aërial space, and mounts the winged gales;
O’er earth and ocean wide prepared to soar,
Her dreaded arm a beamy javelin bore,
Ponderous and vast: which, when her fury burns,
Proud tyrants humbles, and whole hosts o’erturns.
From high Olympus prone her flight she bends,
And in the realms of Ithaca descends,
Her lineaments divine, the grave disguise
Of Mentes’ form conceal’d from human eyes
(Mentes, the monarch of the Taphian land);
A glittering spear waved awful in her hand.
There in the portal placed, the heaven-born maid
Enormous riot and misrule survey’d.
On hides of beeves, before the palace gate
(Sad spoils of luxury), the suitors sate.
With rival art, and ardour in their mien,
At chess they vie, to captivate the queen;
Divining of their loves. Attending nigh,
A menial train the flowing bowl supply.
Others, apart, the spacious hall prepare,
And form the costly feast with busy care.

> So spake she, and bound beneath her feet fair sandals, ambrosial, golden, which bare her both over the wet sea and over the boundless land with the breath of the winds: and she took a doughty spear, sharp-pointed with bronze, heavy and mighty and strong, wherewith she vanquisheth the ranks of heroes, for whom the mighty-fathered one destines it. And she fared down from the peaks of Olympus, darting swiftly, and lighted in the town of Ithaca, and stood at the porch of Odysseus, on the threshold of the court; and in her hand she held the brazen spear, disguised as a stranger, even Mentor, the captain of the Taphians. And she found the reckless suitors. Howbeit, they on their part were gladdening their heart with draughts before the doors, sitting on the hides of oxen which they had slain themselves: and the heralds and swift attendants, some mingling wine and water in the mixing-bowls, and others with many-perforated sponges washing the tables and setting them forth, and others carving off great portions of flesh. Lo, godlike Telemachus far the first beheld her, for he sat amid the suitors, cherishing his grieved heart, pondering within his soul for his noble father, whether from somewhere coming he should scatter the suitors throughout the halls, and get honour for himself, and bear sway in the house. With these thoughts in mind, and parted from the suitors, he marked grey-eyed Athene. And he went straightway to the porch, and wrath stirred in his heart that a stranger should thus stand at the gates: and drawing nigh he clasped her right hand, and received the brazen spear, and spake unto her winged words, saying: Hail, stranger; thou shalt find entertainment with us: but anon, when thou hast supped, thou shalt tell me whereof thou hast need.

Minor deviations include the incorrect name 'Mentor' (should be Mentes for fidelity) and slightly fewer particles than ideal, but it could easily be mistaken for their work.

Nor yet hast thou come to Ithaca, nor seen thy wife in the halls.

> The rest in haste forsook the pleasing shore,
Or, the charm tasted, had return’d no more.
Now placed in order on their banks, they sweep
The sea’s smooth face, and cleave the hoary deep:
With heavy hearts we labour through the tide,
To coasts unknown, and oceans yet untried.

“The land of Cyclops first, a savage kind,
Nor tamed by manners, nor by laws confined:
Untaught to plant, to turn the glebe, and sow,
They all their products to free nature owe:
The soil, untill’d, a ready harvest yields,
With wheat and barley wave the golden fields;
Spontaneous wines from weighty clusters pour,
And Jove descends in each prolific shower,
By these no statues and no rights are known,
No council held, no monarch fills the throne;
But high on hills, or airy cliffs, they dwell,
Or deep in caves whose entrance leads to hell.
Each rules his race, his neighbour not his care,
Heedless of others, to his own severe.

> Howbeit I urged on the rest of my company to bestir themselves and go on board the swift ships, lest peradventure one should eat of the lotus and forget the way of his returning. Anon they embarked, and sat them down upon the benches in order, and smote the grey sea with their oars. Thence we sailed onward with sorrowful hearts: Lo, to the land of the haughty lawless Cyclopes we came, who trusting in the immortal gods plant not with their hands nor plough; but all things grow there unsown and untilled, wheat and barley, yea, and vines bearing wine with goodly clusters, and the rain of Zeus maketh increase thereof. To them be no assemblies that sit for counsel, nor ordinances; but they dwell in the high crests of the mountains in hollow caves, and each giveth law to his children and wives, nor reck they aught one of another. Nor do huntsmen enter her who amid the woodland suffer woes, pursuing the crests of the mountains. Nor doth she fail of flocks nor fallows, but unsown and untilled she lieth all days long, and nourisheth bleating goats. For the Cyclopes have no ships with crimson benches, nor shipwrights among them who might build well-benched ships to accomplish all their need, coming unto cities of men, even as many men over the sea in ships fare each to each: for had they such ships, then would they have laboured to make yon isle a city well-builded. Howbeit not all untoward is she, but would bear all fruits in their seasons: for beside the shores of the grey salt sea are meadows soft and dewy, wherein vines would be unfailing; yea, and smooth plowland would there be, for deep soil lieth thereunder, very fat always in the year, inasmuch as it is exceeding rich beneath. And therein is a haven fair to enter, wherein is no need of cable or anchor-cast, nor to make fast stern-ropes, but drawing up their ships they may tarry till the hearts of the sailors urge thereto and fair breezes blow.

**Rationale:** The pipeline output captures Butcher & Lang's archaic prose style exceptionally well, with consistent high archaism (particles like 'Howbeit,' 'anon,' 'peradventure,' 'Lo,' 'yea'; verbs like 'smote,' 'maketh,' 'giveth,' 'reck'), paratactic chaining of clauses, Greek names (Cyclopes, Zeus), and elevated, KJV-like diction mirroring Greek hypotaxis. It preserves the solemn, historical fidelity without modernization or abbreviation. Minor deviations include slightly awkward phrasing in one clause ('huntsmen enter her who amid the woodland suffer woes') and absence of fixed epithets (none prominent in this passage), but overall it reads indistinguishably from their samples.

**Key gaps:** Slightly garbled syntax in one descriptive clause about huntsmen and woodlands, less fluid than B&L's precision.; No second-person forms or major epithets present (not applicable to passage).
**Key matches:** Abundant archaic particles and inverted syntax ('To them be no assemblies...', 'nor reck they aught...').; Paratactic long sentences with 'and,' 'but,' 'nor,' 'for' chaining.; Formulaic Homeric details rendered verbatim in spirit (e.g., unsown growth, Zeus's rain, cave-dwellers).; Grey sea phrasing and sorrowful hearts echo B&L's epithet fidelity and tone.

> Faultful Ægisthus, who to death was done[3]
By young Orestes, Agamemnon’s son.
His memory to the Immortals then
Mov’d Jove thus

**Pipeline output:**
> Far-famed Orestes, son of Agamemnon,
Slew him outright; whence Jove th'eternal Sire,
Cloud-gath'ring 'mongst deathless Pow'rs 'gan,
Remembering, speak: 'O men unwise, whose ire
Impeacheth gods for ills that from us flow,
When by their own mad follies (past their date)
They heap on heads woes infinite! Ev'n so
Doth Aegisthus, beyond his destined fate,
Espouse Atrides' much-lov'd royal wife,
And slay him home-returning, well aware
Of th'utter ruin that shall mar his life;
For we before had warn'd him, sending there
The gold-rod-wielded Argicide, quick-ey'd,
Swift-ankled Messenger, with charge precise:
'Slay thou not him, nor woo his wedded bride,
Lest from Orestes, Atreus' son, arise
Vengeance when ripen'd to his virile years,
And for his lov'd soil burneth!' Thus the god,
Hermes gold-rod-adorn'd, his message bears;
Yet sway'd not Aegisthus' soul from the trod
Ruin-minding paths; now hath he paid the whole
With ruthless end. O men unwise, whose lusts
Raise their own ruines headlong, blame the pole
For self-betraying cries, O headstrong gusts!

O Father Jove, our Sire, most high of Pow'rs,
Chief King of Kings, that wretch in ruin lies
O'erwhelm'd with endless shame; so others dowers
Of death receive who such high outrages plies!
But for Ulysses, sage Laertiades,
Much-skill'd, much-wrong'd, my heart doth burn and bleed,
Who far from friends endures calamities
On sea-girt isle, the navel of the sea indeed,
Wood-thronged, where Nymph divine hath haunt and home,
Ruin-soul'd daughter of the huge-pillar'd knave
Atlas (who knows the vast profound, where foam
And surges boil, of all the Ocean wave,
And holds the long pillars that prop earth and sky
'Twixt boundless cope and ground); she holds him fast,
The wretched man, with soft deceits aye,
And sug'red, wily words that never wast,
To charm his wits that he forget fair Ithaca;
Yet he, Ulysses, yearns for th'up-ascendent smoke
Of his lov'd land, and death would rather ta'en,
Than ling'ring in that woe. Nor yet to thee...

**Rationale:** The pipeline output captures Chapman's elevated Elizabethan archaism, compound epithets (e.g., 'gold-rod-wielded Argicide', 'cloud-gath'ring'), Latin names (Jove, Argicide, Laertiades), moral appraisals ('O men unwise'), complex syntax, and enjambed verse paragraphs exceptionally well, aligning closely with his prophetic, allegorical tone. However, the most critical formal requirement—consistent rhyming heroic couplets—is fundamentally flawed, with frequent non-rhymes (e.g., Agamemnon/Sire, flow/date, wife/aware) and slant rhymes disrupting the mandatory aa bb scheme seen in Chapman's samples. While iambic pentameter is mostly intact, the defective rhymes prevent it from being plausibly mistaken for Chapman.

**Key gaps:** Inconsistent and often absent rhymes in supposed heroic couplets (e.g., Sire/gan, date/so, arise/years), violating the core verse form; Some lines strain meter or use imperfect scansion due to rhyme-forced diction
**Key matches:** Dense archaism and inversions (e.g., 'gan, Remembering, speak', 'doth burn and bleed'); Invented hyphenated epithets (e.g., 'Ruin-minding paths', 'much-skill'd, much-wrong'd'); Moral commentary insertions ('O men unwise, whose lusts Raise their own ruines'); Latin names and patronymics (Argicide, Laertiades, Atrides); Long, labyrinthine sentences with enjambment across 4-10+ lines

Thus spake the wine-gorg'd Cyclops, laid him flat / Supine; then stretch'd his monstrous neck; all-subduing Sleep seiz'd fast; / From throat wine spouted, man's-flesh gobbets too; wine-oppress'd / He belch'd. Then I th' olive-stake 'neath ashes huge did thrust / (O mates, take heart! lest faint-heart any shrink, and from the deed / Untimely start), to make it kindle; soon the green wood gleam'd, / Though raw, with wondrous heat; then nearer drew I from th' embers, / My fellows round me stood; great courage heav'nly pow'r inspir'd / (For virtue's sleight impiety's brute force doth still outgird). / They grasp'd the olive-long and sharp-prick'd beam, in deep eye thrust; / I from above bore down and whirl'd it round, as shipwright skilled / Bores mast or beam with auger swift, while mates below with strap / On either side fast-holden, turn th' eternal circle—still / The work runs true, nor falters, fate's unswerving wheel doth fill. / So we th' fire-pointed stake in blood-belching eye-socket whirl'd, / Hot gore around it stream'd; lids, brows, scorch'd roots with fume enshroud, / Fire-singe'd depths sear'd through. As smith his great axe or adze quells / In cold bath hissing loud (therein iron's strength securely dwells, / And virtue's patient fire doth raging heat in temp'ring wise compel), / E'en so about th' olive-stake his eyeball hiss'd and swell'd. / Dread groan the Cyclops gave; the rocky roof with clamour rang; / We, fear-struck, back drew; yet he th' gore-clogg'd beam from socket wrung, / And hurl'd afar with savage hands. Then Polyphemus loud / His cave-dwell'd fellows call'd, in wind-sway'd high-seen caverns shroud: / They flock'd from ev'ry side, at cave-mouth stood, and ask'd his woe: / 'What ails thee, Polyphemus, thus through ambrosial night to lowe, / And wake us sleepless all? Drives any force thy flocks away? / Or slays he thee with guile or might?' From den stout Polyphemus they: / 'Friends, Nobody with wile nor force me slays!' ... / 'If then alone some god's disease thou bear'st, as likes the high, / No flight from Jove's great will; to Neptune pray, thy sea-lord sire.' / Thus they, departing; but my loved heart laugh'd glad within, / That name and flawless counsel of city-razer Laertiades / Beguil'd them.

**Rationale:** The pipeline output captures Chapman's archaic register, inverted syntax, hyphenated epithets, Latin/patronymic names, moral commentary, and amplified similes effectively, aligning with his philosophical and oratorical values. However, it fundamentally fails the most critical constraint: consistent rhyming heroic couplets, presenting instead irregular, mostly unrhymed lines with sporadic slant rhymes and uneven meter that disrupt the verse form. This prevents it from being plausibly mistaken for Chapman's unmistakable rhymed structure.

**Key gaps:** No consistent rhyming in heroic couplets (aa bb cc); most lines do not rhyme, resembling free verse more than Chapman's mandatory form; Irregular iambic pentameter with frequent metrical disruptions; Lineation via slashes obscures enjambment into proper verse paragraphs
**Key matches:** Dense Elizabethan archaisms (spake, seiz'd, th', doth, 'twill) and inverted syntax; Invented compound epithets (wine-gorg'd Cyclops, all-subduing Sleep, city-razer Laertiades, gore-clogg'd beam); Moral appraisals inserted (virtue's sleight impiety's brute force doth still outgird; O wise sleight!); Amplified similes (shipwright and smith, extended with moral weight); Latin names and patronymics (Polyphemus, Jove, Neptune, Laertiades); Complex, labyrinthine syntax with parentheticals

Where baths for all the year their use supplied,
Whose waters were so pure they would not stain,

Apt to purge stains, for that purg’d stain within,
Which by the water’s pure store was not seen.
These, here arriv’d, the mules uncoach’d, and drave
Up to the gulfy river’s shore, that gave
Sweet grass to them. The maids from coach then took
Their clothes, and steep’d them in the sable brook:
Then put them into springs, and trod them clean
With cleanly feet; adventuring wagers then
Who should have soonest and most cleanly done.

And led to sweet-clov'rd meads by eddying flood,

Themselves their weeds from cart in hand did take,
To dark-stream's strand bore down, with emulous haste
In trenches deep they cleans'd each soil'd estate,
All scouring foulness cast they then away;
And on the shore where billow-beating sea
Most flaxen weeds with surge and spray did sway,
In order fair their raiment did array.

Ambrosial-sweet; and by the river's banks
Took blest repast, whilst Phœbus' beams did coil
Their weeds to dry, midst virtue's sacred ranks.

Damsels and dame to ball-play fell with speed,

In boar-chace fierce and harts' swift-footed throng;

Where souls from fleshly lures their freedom win,

To yoke their mules and fold fair weeds again,

Who to Phæacian city might conduct
Much-enduring Laertiades, earth's renown.

**Rationale:** The output captures Chapman's elevated Elizabethan register, dense archaisms, inverted syntax, compound epithets, Latin names, and moral insertions like 'O virtuous mood!' and 'Virtue triumphant,' aligning with his philosophical allegory. It employs verse paragraphs with enjambment and expands the simile impressively. However, the most critical failure is inconsistent heroic couplets—many line pairs do not rhyme (e.g., mood/take, take/haste, array/bath'd), violating the mandatory rhyme scheme, with some slant or failed rhymes undermining the form.

**Key gaps:** Inconsistent rhyming couplets (e.g., mood/take, take/haste, array/bath'd)—rhyme is the core formal requirement; Extends far beyond the ground-truth passage into later content like the Diana simile and Ulysses' awakening; Occasional metric irregularities and less labyrinthine syntax than Chapman's breathless embedding
**Key matches:** Dense Elizabethan archaisms (reach'd, loos'd, clov'rd, weeds, doth implied in structure); Invented compound epithets (fair-stream'd-river, deep-wash'd, sweet-clov'rd, billow-beating, shaft-impelling); Latin names and patronymics (Phœbus, Jove, Pallas/Minerva, Laertiades, Phæacian); Added moral appraisals ('O virtuous mood!', 'spotless purity', 'Virtue triumphant'); Expanded simile beyond Greek with Chapmanesque amplification

**Known translation (George Chapman (1616)):**
> The man, O Muse, inform, that many a way[1]
Wound with his wisdom to his wished stay;
That wander’d wondrous far, when he the town
Of sacred Troy had sack’d and shiver’d down;
The cities of a world of nations,
With all their manners, minds, and fashions,
He saw and knew; at sea felt many woes,
Much care sustain’d, to save from overthrows
Himself and friends in their retreat for home;
But so their fates he could not overcome,
Though much he thirsted it. O men unwise,
They perish’d by their own impieties!
That in their hunger’s rapine would not shun
The oxen of the lofty-going Sun,
Who therefore from their eyes the day bereft
Of safe return. These acts, in some part left,
Tell us, as others, deified Seed of Jove.

**Pipeline output:**
> Much labour'd he, t' preserve his soul and friends' return
To home; yet could not save them, though he burn'd
With hot desire. O fools unwise, they perish'd by
Their own rash impieties! Those infants fond that ply
The beeves of lofty-going Sun Hyperion ate,
Whence he their eyes bereft of home-returning fate.
Of these, O goddess thou, Jove's daughter Pallas, tell,
And us inform.

There all beside, who 'scap'd the steepy wrack
Of war and sea, had reach'd their country back;
But him alone, much-enduring Laertiades,
Of all return bereft, and wife; the nymph Calypso, bless'd
With goddess-fairness, holds in cavern'd depths profound,
Fain to her spouse eternal him to make and bound.
But when th' appointed year (which cloud-gath'ring Jove
With heav'nly powers decreed) came circling home,
To his Ithaca ordain'd; not there from toils was free
The man, nor yet with friends belov'd in company.

All gods pitied, save Neptune the earth-shaker,
Who rag'd unsoft'ned 'gainst god-like Ulysses e'er,
Till he his own soil kiss'd. But he meantime
Besought far Ethiop-rovers, utmost men of time,
In two parts cleft, some at Hyperion's set,
Some at his rise.

**Rationale:** The output nails Chapman's archaic diction, inverted syntax, compound epithets, Latinized names, moral interjections, and allegorical tone, creating a similar elevated, prophetic feel. However, it fundamentally fails the most important constraint—consistent rhyming heroic couplets—with sporadic, slant, or missing rhymes in most line pairs, disrupting the verse form. Meter is mostly iambic pentameter but inconsistent in syllable count and occasional short lines, preventing it from matching Chapman's formal precision.

**Key gaps:** Inconsistent rhyming: most couplets lack rhyme (e.g., return/home, burn'd/by, profound/bound, shaker/Ulysses); Meter irregularities: some lines under 10 syllables (e.g., 'And us inform'), others over; Explicit 'Hyperion' instead of Chapman's 'lofty-going Sun' alone; Uncharacteristic invocation to Pallas mid-passage
**Key matches:** Dense archaisms and inversions: 'labour'd he', 't'', 'burn'd', 'perish'd', ''scap'd', 'th' appointed'; Compound epithets: 'much-enduring Laertiades', 'cloud-gath'ring Jove', 'lofty-going Sun', 'goddess-fairness'; Moral appraisal: 'O fools unwise, they perish'd by / Their own rash impieties!'; Latin names and patronymics: Laertiades, Jove, Pallas, Neptune, Ulysses; Complex, enjambed syntax in verse paragraphs with participials and parentheticals

**Known translation (George Chapman (1616)):**
> “Arriv’d now at our ship, we launch’d, and set
Our mast up, put forth sail, and in did get
Our late-got cattle. Up our sails, we went,
My wayward fellows mourning now th’ event.[1]
A good companion yet, a foreright wind,
Circe (the excellent utt’rer of her mind)
Supplied our murmuring consorts with, that was
Both speed and guide to our adventurous pass.
All day our sails stood to the winds, and made
Our voyage prosp’rous. Sun then set, and shade
All ways obscuring, on the bounds we fell
Of deep Oceanus, where people dwell
Whom a perpetual cloud obscures outright,
To whom the cheerful sun lends never light,
Nor when he mounts the star-sustaining heaven,
Nor when he stoops earth, and sets up the even,
But night holds fix’d wings, feather’d all with banes,
Above those most unblest Cimmerians.
Here drew we up our ship, our sheep withdrew,
And walk’d the shore till we attain’d the view,
Of that sad region Circe had foreshow’d;

**Pipeline output:**
> Sail we much-griev'd, tears down in streams down-pouring
O'er cheeks with ruthful floods, our woes out-wearing.
Behind us then th' azure-prow'd ship did send
Fair Circe's swift-wing'd gale, our goodly friend,
Tress-golden Circe, dread voice'd Goddess, wise
All-knowing. Arms throughout the bark we stow'd; there sat we;
Wind and steersman skill'd her course did see.
All day her sails stretch'd full the seas did cleave,
Till Phoebus set, and all the ways receive
Dark shades. To deep-flowing Ocean's bound
She came, where Cimmerians' woful town
And folk in cloud and mist shroud ever lie,
Nor Sun's bright rays look down from vaulted sky
With any beam, when to his starry throne
He climbs, or back to earth from heav'n comes down,
But deadly night stretch'd o'er these caitiffs' pain
Lies evermore—O fools, by sins your bane!
There fast we beach'd our bark, rich sheep forth drew,
And to Ocean's stream our mournful steps we threw,
Till Circe's promis'd place we gain'd aright.
There Perimedes, Eurilochus, held tight
The holy victims; I my sharp sword tore
From thigh, and pit a cubit-round up-bore,
This way and that libations pouring free
To all the ghostly rout—first honey-sweet,
Then sweet wine, water third; white meal thereon beat.
Much kneel'd I to th' wan heads, and vows did swear,
To Ithaca return'd, best cow to tear,
Her pyre with treasure plenteous filling high;
To Tiresias a black ram singly, by
Itself from our rich flocks excelling all.
Thus with light pray'rs and vows I freed their thrall,

**Rationale:** The output captures Chapman's archaic register, inverted syntax, hyphenated epithets, and moral commentary, with enjambment and complex structure evoking his verse paragraphs. However, it fundamentally fails the mandatory heroic couplets, as rhymes are sporadic, slant, or absent in many pairs (e.g., wise/we, see/cleave, sky/down), disrupting the audible rhyming iambic pentameter essential to Chapman's form. Some lines deviate from strict pentameter, and it extends beyond the sample without matching Chapman's precise phrasing or cumulative moral allegory.

**Key gaps:** Inconsistent rhyming couplets (primary formal constraint violated); Slant or missing rhymes in multiple pairs (e.g., pouring/wearing, sky/down); Occasional metric irregularities beyond iambic pentameter; Greek names like Eurilochus retained instead of full Latinization where applicable
**Key matches:** Dense Elizabethan archaisms (th', stretch'd, heav'n, caitiffs); Hyphenated compound epithets (much-griev'd, azure-prow'd, tress-golden); Added moral appraisal ('O fools, by sins your bane!'); Inverted syntax and stacked participials for labyrinthine effect; Latinized names like Phoebus
