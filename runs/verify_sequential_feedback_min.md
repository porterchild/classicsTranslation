## Final Translation

Just as geographers, Sosius Senecio, push the unknown parts of the earth to the outer edges of their maps and add notes like 'sandy deserts without water and full of beasts,' 'bottomless mire,' 'Scythian cold,' or 'frozen sea,' so in writing my Parallel Lives, after covering eras accessible through plausible reasoning and solid history, it would be fitting to say of the earlier periods: 'Beyond lie monstrous and tragic matters, the domain of poets and myth-makers—no credibility or clarity remains.'

After publishing my accounts of Lycurgus the lawgiver and King Numa, it seemed reasonable—now that my history had reached his era—to include Romulus too. But as I pondered (in Aeschylus's words) such a luminary, who could measure up? Whom to set against him? Who was a match? It seemed best to pair the founder of beautiful and renowned Athens with the father of invincible and glorious Rome.

May we therefore succeed in purifying the mythical through reason, making it submit and assume history's likeness. But wherever it arrogantly scorns plausibility and refuses to blend with probability, we'll appeal to fair-minded readers who regard ancient accounts with indulgence.

### Paragraph 1

ὥσπερ ἐν ταῖς γεωγραφίαις, ὦ Σόσσιε Σενεκίων, οἱ ἱστορικοὶ τὰ διαφεύγοντα τὴν γνῶσιν αὐτῶν τοῖς ἐσχάτοις μέρεσι τῶν πινάκων πιεζοῦντες, αἰτίας παραγράφουσιν ὅτι "τὰ δ᾽ ἐπέκεινα θῖνες ἄνυδροι καὶ θηριώδεις" ἢ "πηλὸς ἀϊδνὴς" ἢ "σκυθικὸν κρύος" ἢ "πέλαγος πεπηγός," οὕτως ἐμοὶ περὶ τὴν τῶν βίων τῶν παραλλήλων γραφήν, τὸν ἐφικτὸν εἰκότι λόγῳ καὶ βάσιμον ἱστορίᾳ πραγμάτων ἐχομένῃ χρόνον διελθόντι, περὶ τῶν ἀνωτέρω καλῶς εἶχεν εἰπεῖν· "τὰ δ᾽ ἐπέκεινα τερατώδη καὶ τραγικὰ ποιηταὶ καὶ μυθογράφοι νέμονται, καὶ οὐκέτ᾽ ἔχει πίστιν οὐδὲ σαφήνειαν."

### Paragraph 2

ἐπεὶ δὲ τὸν περὶ Λυκούργου τοῦ νομοθέτου καὶ Νομᾶ τοῦ βασιλέως λόγον ἐκδόντες, ἐδοκοῦμεν οὐκ ἂν ἀλόγως τῷ Ῥωμύλῳ προσαναβῆναι, πλησίον τῶν χρόνων αὐτοῦ τῇ ἱστορίᾳ γεγονότες, σκοποῦντι δέ μοι τοιῷδε φωτί (κατ᾽ Αἰσχύλον) τίς ξυμβήσεται; τίν᾽ ἀντιτάξω τῷδε; τίς φερέγγυος; ἐφαίνετο τὸν τῶν καλῶν καὶ ἀοιδίμων οἰκιστὴν Ἀθηνῶν ἀντιστῆσαι καὶ παραβαλεῖν τῷ πατρὶ τῆς ἀνικήτου καὶ μεγαλοδόξου Ῥώμης,

### Paragraph 3

εἴη μὲν οὖν ἡμῖν ἐκκαθαιρόμενον λόγῳ τὸ μυθῶδες ὑπακοῦσαι καὶ λαβεῖν ἱστορίας ὄψιν, ὅπου δ᾽ ἂν αὐθαδῶς τοῦ πιθανοῦ περιφρονῇ καὶ μὴ δέχηται τὴν πρὸς τὸ εἰκὸς μῖξιν, εὐγνωμόνων ἀκροατῶν δεησόμεθα καὶ πρᾴως τὴν ἀρχαιολογίαν προσδεχομένων.
