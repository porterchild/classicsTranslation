**Known translation (Samuel Butler (1900)):**
> “Then, when we had got down to the sea shore we drew our ship into the water and got her mast and sails into her; we also put the sheep on board and took our places, weeping and in great distress of mind. Circe, that great and cunning goddess, sent us a fair wind that blew dead aft and staid steadily with us keeping our sails all the time well filled; so we did whatever wanted doing to the ship’s gear and let her go as the wind and helmsman headed her. All day long her sails were full as she held her course over the sea, but when the sun went down and darkness was over all the earth, we got into the deep waters of the river Oceanus, where lie the land and city of the Cimmerians who live enshrouded in mist and darkness which the rays of the sun never pierce neither at his rising nor as he goes down again out of the heavens, but the poor wretches live in one long melancholy night. When we got there we beached the ship, took the sheep out of her, and went along by the waters of Oceanus till we came to the place of which Circe had told us.

**Pipeline output:**
> We went on grieving and in tears. The ship behind us spread her sail; she was a good comrade sent by Circe. We stowed our arms about the ship and sat down, while wind and steersman kept her on her course. All day her sails were filled as she crossed the sea, and when the sun went down darkness fell on all the ways. She reached the bounds of Ocean. Here was the land and city of the Cimmerians, wrapped in mist and cloud. The sun never looks down on them with his rays, neither when he climbs to the starry heaven nor when he turns back from heaven towards the earth, but deadly night is spread continually over these wretched mortals. When we came here, we beached the ship and took out the sheep. We ourselves went on beside the streams of Ocean till we reached the place Circe had told us of. There Perimedes and Eurylochus held the victims. I drew my sharp sword from beside my thigh, dug a pit a foot each way, and poured a drink-offering round it to all the dead—first with milk and honey, next with sweet wine, thirdly with water, and last with white barley meal. I called on the poor dead heads to grant that when I came to Ithaca I would sacrifice in my house a cow, the best I had, and pile the pyre with fine gifts; moreover I would offer Tiresias apart from the others a black ram, the best in all my flocks. When I had thus prayed and made my drink-offerings to the multitudes of the dead,

**Rationale:** The pipeline output captures Butler's brisk, clear Victorian prose with medium-length active-voice sentences, compound structures using 'and'/'but'/'while', zero archaisms, and practical narration of supernatural elements like Circe's wind. It uses period connectives like 'moreover' and selective epithet omission effectively. Minor deviations include slightly poetic phrasing ('good comrade' for the ship, 'darkness fell on all the ways', 'starry heaven') and inconsistent naming ('Ocean' vs. 'Oceanus'), preventing a perfect match.

**Key gaps:** Missing vivid epithet for Circe ('that great and cunning goddess'); Inconsistent naming ('bounds of Ocean' then 'Oceanus'); Occasional poetic flourishes ('good comrade' ship personification, 'starry heaven', 'all the ways') not in Butler's matter-of-fact style
**Key matches:** No archaisms, standard SVO syntax, modern verbs; Medium sentences with 'and'/'but'/'while' compounds for brisk rhythm; Practical ritual description with 'moreover' and listing; Naturalistic divine elements (wind from Circe understated); Wretched mortals and deadly night phrasing echoes Butler's tone
