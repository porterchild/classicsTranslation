[paragraph 1] reference input [dryden_clough]: As geographers, Sosius Senecio, crowd into the edges of their maps parts of the world which escape their knowledge, adding notes, in the margin, to the effect, that beyond this lie sandy deserts full of wild beasts, unapproachable bogs, Scythian ice, and frozen sea, so, in the chart of my lives, from those periods which probable reasoning can reach to, and where the history of facts can find firm footing, in passing those remote ages which are accessible only to conjecture, I might well say, Beyond this there is nothing but prodigies and fictions, the only inhabitants are the poets and inventors of fables, there is no other certainty, or reality.
[paragraph 1] reference input [perrin]: Just as geographers, O Sossius Senecio, crowd on to the outer edges of their maps the parts of the earth which elude their knowledge, with explanatory notes that "What lies beyond is sandy desert without water and full of wild beasts," or "blind marsh," or "Scythian cold," or "frozen sea," so in the writing of my Parallel Lives, now that I have traversed those periods of time which are accessible to probable reasoning and which afford basis for a history dealing with facts, I might well say of the earlier periods: "What lies beyond is full of marvels and unreality, a land of poets and fabulists, of doubt and obscurity."

[paragraph 1] [iter 1] [sequential] perplexity feedback: Perplexity feedback from glm4.7flash.gguf (llama.cpp exact token scoring): perplexity=112.945, avg_logprob=-4.7269, token_count=54, expansion_steps=17.
[paragraph 1] [iter 1] [sequential] observations: a) Plain restate for 7yo: We'd love to use smart talk to clean away fairy-tale stuff and see real history clearly. But if old stories act stubborn, ignore what's likely, and won't mix with good sense, we need kind listeners who patiently accept ancient tales. b) Source-close: May it be for us to obey the mythical purified by reason and grasp history's view; but wherever it arrogantly scorns the plausible and rejects mixture with the probable, we shall beg sensible hearers gently receiving the antiquarian study. c) Candidates: 1. Clean myths with logic, see history plain. 2. Smart words wipe fairy tales; stubborn myths need patient friends (breaks syntax by simplifying contrasts to sequence).
[paragraph 1] [iter 1] [sequential] translation:
It would be good for us to listen as reason cleans away the made-up stories and lets us see real history. But if those stories stubbornly ignore what seems believable and refuse to mix with what is likely, we will need kind listeners who patiently welcome the ancient accounts.
[paragraph 1] [iter 1] [sequential] translation self-scores: faithfulness=9, readability=10, modernity=9
[paragraph 1] [iter 1] self-judge...
[paragraph 1] [iter 1] [sequential] judgment: Strong readability for a young audience with smooth flow and modern tone, but faithfulness dips slightly from loose personification of 'mythical' as passive stories and minor abstraction in 'what seems believable'; simplify vocab further without dropping contrast.
[paragraph 1] [iter 1] [sequential] strengths: Clear two-part structure preserves core contrast (purified myths vs. stubborn ones); simple sentences flow naturally; kid-friendly terms like 'made-up stories' and 'real history' hit 7yo target; merged phrasing improves pace without losing logic.
[paragraph 1] [iter 1] [sequential] issues: 'Listen as reason cleans away' shifts source's 'hearken to the mythical [while] being cleansed' into active process, softening the obedience nuance; 'stubbornly ignore what seems believable' and 'refuse to mix with what is likely' use semi-abstract 'believable/likely' over plainer 'makes sense/probable events'; 'patiently welcome the ancient accounts' is dignified but 'welcome' indirect vs. source's 'receive'—feels slightly bookish for 7yo.
[paragraph 1] [iter 1] [sequential] revision plan: Revise first sentence to: 'It would be nice if we could hear the make-believe parts get cleaned by reason so we see true history.' Second: 'But if they rudely skip what makes sense and won't blend with likely facts, we'll need nice listeners who calmly accept the old tales.' Swap 'stubbornly/believable/likely/patiently welcome' to 'rudely/skip/makes sense/likely facts/calmly accept'; change 'kind listeners' to 'nice listeners' for plainness; test full read-aloud for 7yo flow.

[paragraph 1] [iter 2] [sequential] perplexity feedback: Perplexity feedback from glm4.7flash.gguf (llama.cpp exact token scoring): perplexity=111.543, avg_logprob=-4.7144, token_count=54, expansion_steps=16.
[paragraph 1] [iter 2] [sequential] observations: a) Plain restate for 7yo: 'We'd love to use smart thinking to clean away fairy tale stuff and see true history. But if stories won't mix with what makes sense, we need nice patient listeners for old tales.' b) Source-close: 'Would it be for us, reason purifying the mythical, to listen and grasp history's view; but wherever it arrogantly scorns the plausible and rejects mix with the likely, we shall need good-judging hearers gently welcoming the ancient lore.' c) Candidates: 'Reason should scrub myths clean so we hear real facts. But stubborn tales ignoring truth need patient friends.' (breaks syntax); 'Let logic wipe fairy tales for history sight, else kind ears for ancient ways.'; 'We want reason to clear myths and show history; if myths defy likelihood, seek gentle ancient-story fans.'
[paragraph 1] [iter 2] [sequential] translation:
It would be great if we let clear thinking wash away the fairy-tale parts so we can hear and see true history. But if those stories stubbornly ignore what seems true and refuse to blend with it, we will need kind listeners who patiently welcome the old tales.

[paragraph 1] [iter 2] self-judge...
[paragraph 1] [iter 2] [sequential] judgment: Strong on 7yo readability and modern flow, but faithfulness dips by softening purification/submission of myths into removal and blurring who obeys what.
[paragraph 1] [iter 2] [sequential] strengths: Perfect simple sentences and vocabulary for 7yo; natural contrast with 'but if'; modern casual tone without slang; merges optative wish into direct 'great if' without losing intent.
[paragraph 1] [iter 2] [sequential] issues: 'Wash away the fairy-tale parts' implies deleting myths, not purifying them to make them obey reason (ἐκκαθαιρόμενον λόγῳ + ὑπακοῦσαι); 'hear and see true history' conflates myths obeying with gaining history's view; 'what seems true' underspecifies πιθανός/εἰκός as probable/likely events; 'old tales' fits but softens ἀρχαιολογίαν as full ancient inquiry.
[paragraph 1] [iter 2] [sequential] revision plan: Change to: 'We wish clear thinking could clean the fairy-tale stuff so it obeys and we see real history clearly.' for first clause to add submission; 'But if the fairy-tale stuff rudely ignores likely truths and won't mix with them,' to sharpen subject/action; 'we'll need kind listeners who gently accept the ancient stories.' Keep sentence lengths under 20 words; replace 'stubbornly ignore what seems true' with 'rudely ignores likely truths' for plain dignity and faithfulness.

[paragraph 1] [iter 3] [sequential] observations: a) Plain restatement for 7yo: I wish smart talk could clean out the make-believe parts so we hear and see real history. But if those stories bossily ignore what seems likely and won't mix with it, we'll need kind listeners who patiently accept the old stories. b) Source-close sketch: Would that for us, mythical purified by reason, we obey and grasp history's view; but wherever it arrogantly scorns plausible and rejects mix with likely, we'll need good-judging hearers who mildly welcome ancient lore. c) Candidates: 'Use reason to wash myths away for true history sight - great! But stubborn myths shun likelihood? Need patient kind folks for old tales.' (breaks syntax); 'Clean myths with logic to see history; if they won't blend with probable, seek understanding audience.'; 'Wish logic scrubbed fairy bits for history view. Stubborn myths need gentle listeners.'

[paragraph 1] [iter 3] self-judge...
[paragraph 1] [iter 3] [sequential] judgment: Strong simplification for child readability while mostly preserving contrast and wish structure, but minor fidelity loss in softening 'despises probable' to 'ignore likely' and vague 'old tales' for precise 'ancient inquiry'; flows naturally but perplexity signals slight awkwardness in phrasing.
[paragraph 1] [iter 3] [sequential] strengths: Excellent 7yo readability with short sentences, concrete verbs like 'wash away' and 'mix'; captures core wish-contrast-need without dropping relations; modern natural flow avoids Greek optative stiffness.
[paragraph 1] [iter 3] [sequential] issues: Faithfulness dips on 'stubbornly ignore what seems likely' (source: despises probable/reasonable, stronger contempt) and 'old tales' (source: ἀρχαιολογίαν=ancient lore/history, not just tales); 'clear thinking' abstracts λόγῳ (reason/argument); 'kind listeners' softens εὐγνωμόνων (sensible/good-judging); minor personification of stories as agent.
[paragraph 1] [iter 3] [sequential] revision plan: Change to: 'I wish we could use reason to clean out the fairy-tale stuff and get a clear look at real history. But if it stubbornly scorns what makes sense and won't blend with the believable, we'll need smart listeners who gently accept the ancient stories.' Swap 'make-believe' to 'fairy-tale' for plainer 7yo word; 'wash away' to 'clean out'; 'ignore' to 'scorns'; 'what seems likely/it' to 'what makes sense/the believable' for directness; 'kind' to 'smart' for εὐγνωμόνων; 'patiently welcome old tales' to 'gently accept ancient stories' for precision/flow.

[paragraph 1] final sequential translation:
It would be nice if reason cleaned the pretend parts so we could see the real history. But if they ignore what makes sense and won't fit likely facts, we'll need kind listeners who calmly accept the old tales.

[paragraph 1] final polish notes: Simplified to 7yo level: 'make-believe' to 'pretend', 'hear ... get cleaned by reason' to direct 'reason cleaned' outcome, 'rudely skip' to 'ignore', 'blend with' to 'fit'; smoothed structure for natural flow, preserved wish tone and contrast.
