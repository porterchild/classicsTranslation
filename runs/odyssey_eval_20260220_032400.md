**Known translation (Samuel Butler (1900)):**
> Tell me, O Muse, of that ingenious hero who travelled far and wide
after he had sacked the famous town of Troy. Many cities did he visit,
and many were the nations with whose manners and customs he was
acquainted; moreover he suffered much by sea while trying to save his
own life and bring his men safely home; but do what he might he could
not save his men, for they perished through their own sheer folly in
eating the cattle of the Sun-god Hyperion; so the god prevented them
from ever reaching home. Tell me, too, about all these things, oh
daughter of Jove, from whatsoever source you may know them.

So now all who escaped death in battle or by shipwreck had got safely
home except Ulysses, and he, though he was longing to return to his
wife and country, was detained by the goddess Calypso, who had got him
into a large cave and wanted to marry him. But as years went by, there
came a time when the gods settled that he should go back to Ithaca;
even then, however, when he was among his own people, his troubles were
not yet over; nevertheless all the gods had now begun to pity him
except Neptune, who still persecuted him without ceasing and would not
let him get home.

**Pipeline output:**
> but do what he might he could not save his men, for they perished through their own sheer folly in eating the cattle of the Sun-god Hyperion; so the god prevented them from ever reaching home. Tell me also, goddess, daughter of Jove. By this time all the rest who had escaped utter destruction were safely at home, having escaped both war and sea; but the nymph Calypso kept this one man only in her hollow caves, longing for his homecoming and his wife, as she longed to make him her husband. But when the year had gone round, as the gods had appointed for his return to Ithaca, he was still far from escaping troubles or rejoining his friends. All the gods pitied him except Neptune, who still kept up his grudge against Ulysses till he reached his own land. Meanwhile Neptune had gone to the Ethiopians, who live farthest off of all men, some where Hyperion sets and some where he rises.

**Rationale:** The pipeline output captures Butler's clear, brisk Victorian prose with medium-length sentences, active voice, compound structures using 'but,' 'for,' and 'so,' and correct Latin names like Jove, Neptune, Ulysses, and Hyperion. It retains vivid selective epithets like 'Sun-god Hyperion' and treats gods naturalistically. Minor deviations include a content error misattributing Ulysses' longing to Calypso, an abbreviated invocation, slightly less precise paraphrasing (e.g., 'hollow caves' vs. 'large cave'), and extraneous extra content at the end, but these do not disrupt the overall readable, matter-of-fact tone.

**Key gaps:** Misattributes Ulysses' longing for home to Calypso; Abbreviated Muse invocation missing Butler's fuller phrasing; Adds unrelated content about Neptune and Ethiopians; Delays naming Ulysses and uses participial phrases slightly more complex than Butler's direct style
**Key matches:** Exact match on key Butler phrase 'but do what he might he could not save his men...'; Consistent Latin names and zero archaism with modern verbs/SVO order; Brisk narrative rhythm with Victorian connectives like 'for,' 'so,' 'as'; Naturalistic god treatment and selective epithets

**Known translation (Samuel Butler (1900)):**
> Thus he spoke, and Mercury, guide and guardian, slayer of Argus, did as he was told. Forthwith he bound on his glittering golden sandals with which he could fly like the wind over land and sea. He took the wand with which he seals men’s eyes in sleep or wakes them just as he pleases, and flew holding it in his hand over Pieria; then he swooped down through the firmament till he reached the level of the sea, whose waves he skimmed like a cormorant that flies fishing every hole and corner of the ocean, and drenching its thick plumage in the spray. He flew and flew over many a weary wave, but when at last he got to the island which was his journey’s end, he left the sea and went on by land till he came to the cave where the nymph Calypso lived.

**Pipeline output:**
> Even if he comes home crippled, having drawn his lot from war. For such is his fate, to see his friends again and to reach his home and his own native land. So he spoke, and Mercury the messenger did not disobey. Forthwith he fastened under his feet his glittering golden sandals, which carried him over the sea and over the boundless land on the breath of the wind. He took his wand, with which he charms the eyes of men as he will, or wakes them from sleep; holding this in his hands, Mercury flew. He passed over Pieria and fell from the air into the sea; then he skimmed the waves like a cormorant that flies fishing every hole and corner of the ocean, and wets its thick wings with brine. Like him Mercury rode upon the countless waves. But when he reached the distant island, he left the sea and went on shore till he came to the great cavern where the nymph dwelt; he found her within. A great fire burned on the hearth, and the aroma of burning cedar and thyme filled the island. She sat within, singing a sweet song as she moved to and fro before her loom and wove with a golden shuttle. Round the cave there was a thick wood of alder, poplar, and sweet-smelling cypress trees. Birds with long wings nested therein, owls and hawks and long-tongued sea-mews whose business it was with the waters. A vine was trained upon it and was heavy with grapes. Four springs close together flowed with clear water hard by one another, turned different ways. Soft meadows of violets and selinon bloomed around it. Any god who came there would have marvelled at the sight and been delighted. There Mercury stood and wondered. But when he had feasted his eyes upon all, forthwith he went into the wide cave. But Calypso the goddess recognised him at once when she saw him, for the gods do not go unrecognised by one another.

**Rationale:** The pipeline captures Butler's brisk prose register, correct Latin names, zero archaism, active voice, and selective epithets in a general way, with close matches to the cormorant simile and 'forthwith.' However, it deviates by including an extraneous opening prophecy, an overly lush and extended cave description that slows the efficient pacing, and occasional poetic flourishes like 'breath of the wind' and untranslated 'selinon,' which inflate the supernatural rather than understating it naturalistically. Sentence structure is mostly medium-length but includes wordier lists and compounds that feel less newspaper-brisk.

**Key gaps:** Extraneous content (prophecy opener and full cave description beyond ground truth, reducing briskness); Poetic phrasing ('breath of the wind', 'countless waves', 'fell from the air', 'wets its thick wings with brine'); Untranslated Greek 'selinon' instead of plain Victorian English; Lush nature details (birds, vines, meadows) that elaborate excessively vs. Butler's selective vividness
**Key matches:** Latin names (Mercury, Calypso) used correctly; No archaisms or inversions; standard SVO order ('Mercury flew'); Active voice and 'forthwith' connective; Cormorant simile nearly identical in structure and detail; Naturalistic god treatment (Mercury as practical traveler)

**Known translation (Samuel Butler (1900)):**
> “‘This,’ I answered, ‘must be as it may please heaven, but tell me and tell me and tell me true, I see my poor mother’s ghost close by us; she is sitting by the blood without saying a word, and though I am her own son she does not remember me and speak to me; tell me, Sir, how I can make her know me.’

“‘That,’ said he, ‘I can soon do. Any ghost that you let taste of the blood will talk with you like a reasonable being, but if you do not let them have any blood they will go away again.’

“On this the ghost of Teiresias went back to the house of Hades, for his prophecyings had now been spoken, but I sat still where I was until my mother came up and tasted the blood. Then she knew me at once and spoke fondly to me, saying, ‘My son, how did you come down to this abode of darkness while you are still alive? It is a hard thing for the living to see these places, for between us and them there are great and terrible waters, and there is Oceanus, which no man can cross on foot, but he must have a good ship to take him. Are you all this time trying to find your way home from Troy, and have you never yet got back to Ithaca nor seen your wife in your own house?’

**Pipeline output:**
> But come, tell me this and speak truly of it. I see the ghost of my dead mother sitting near the blood, and she will not taste it, nor endure to look upon her son or speak to him. Tell me, my lord, how she may know me as I am.

I spoke, and he answered me at once: "It is easy. I will put the matter plainly before you. Whomsoever of the dead you allow to come near the blood will speak truly to you, but he whom you keep away will go back again."

So the ghost went into the house of Hades to Tiresias, for he had spoken as fate decreed. But I stayed there without moving until my mother came and drank the dark blood. At once she knew me, and weeping bitterly she said:

"My son, how came you here under this gloom while still alive? It is hard for the living to see such things. For in the midst are great rivers and fearful streams, first the great Ocean, which no man can cross on foot unless he has a good ship. Are you now come here from Troy after long time with ship and companions? Have you not yet reached Ithaca, nor seen your wife in your halls?"

She spoke, and I answered her: "My mother, necessity brought me down to Hades to speak with the ghost of Tiresias the Theban. For I have not yet come near Greece, nor set foot on my own land, but ever since I followed Agamemnon to Ilium to fight the Trojans I have been wandering miserably. But come, tell me this truly. What brought you to this miserable death? Was it long illness, or did Diana slay you with her gentle arrows as she came upon you? Tell me also of my father and of the son I left behind: is my estate still in their hands, or does some other man hold it now, saying that I shall not return? Tell me too of my wife's mind and purpose: does she stay by her son and guard everything safe as before, or has she already married the best of the Greeks?"

**Rationale:** The pipeline output captures Butler's clear, brisk prose, active voice, medium sentences, and natural Victorian dialogue without archaisms or inversions. However, it deviates with slightly elevated phrasing ('nor endure,' 'Whomsoever,' 'dark blood'), a narrative error ('the ghost went... to Tiresias'), and less plain, explanatory tone in divine/ghostly scenes compared to Butler's matter-of-fact accessibility. Spelling ('Tiresias' vs. 'Teiresias') and minor epithet retention also reduce fidelity.

**Key gaps:** Narrative inaccuracy: 'the ghost went into the house of Hades to Tiresias' misattributes the action unlike Butler's clear 'ghost of Teiresias went back'; Elevated diction: 'nor endure,' 'Whomsoever,' 'fearful streams,' 'under this gloom' feel less brisk and plain than Butler's newspaper-like prose; Epithet intrusion: 'dark blood' adds Homeric color Butler simplifies or drops; Spelling and names: 'Tiresias' (not 'Teiresias'), 'Ilium' over 'Troy'
**Key matches:** Zero archaism: modern 'you,' standard SVO syntax like 'I spoke, and he answered'; Natural dialogue: 'tell me, my lord' echoes Butler's 'tell me, Sir'; Latin names: 'Diana' correctly used; Sentence rhythm: medium compounds with 'and/but/for,' active voice, quick readability

**Pipeline output:**
> She spoke, and bound her glittering golden sandals on her feet, which carried her over the sea or boundless land as swiftly as the winds. She took a stout spear tipped with sharp bronze, long, heavy, and strong, with which she beats down ranks of heroes such as fight against her father Jove. She darted down from the peaks of Olympus, and stood in the town of Ithaca before Ulysses' gateway on the threshold of the courtyard. She held a bronze spear in her hand, and seemed a stranger, Mentor the Taphian leader. She found the lordly suitors. Some of them were playing draughts in front of the doors, as they sat on the hides of the oxen which they had killed themselves. For them the criers and busy attendants were mixing wine in the mixing-bowls with water; others kept wiping the tables with sponges full of holes and setting them before the guests, while they carved great quantities of meat. Telemachus saw her long before any one else, for he sat among the suitors, sad at heart and always brooding over his brave father, whether he would come from somewhere and drive the suitors from the house, so that he himself might hold his own and rule his father's halls. With these thoughts in mind, apart from the suitors, he saw Minerva, and went straight to the door. He was vexed that a stranger should be standing so long at the gates; so he went up to her, took her right hand, received her bronze spear, and greeted her with these words: 'Hail, stranger; you are very welcome here. You shall dine with us presently, and then tell us what you want.'

**Rationale:** The pipeline output closely mirrors Butler's brisk, accessible Victorian prose with correct Latin names (Ulysses, Minerva, Jove), zero archaism, standard SVO syntax, active voice, and medium-length compound sentences using 'and,' 'for,' and 'so.' Dialogue feels like natural gentry conversation, and divine elements are understated naturalistically. Minor excess length in one sentence and slightly vivid epithets ('lordly suitors,' 'brave father') prevent a perfect 10, but it could easily be mistaken for Butler.

**Key gaps:** One brooding-thoughts sentence is slightly longer than Butler's typical medium rhythm; Epithets like 'lordly suitors' and 'brave father' are a touch more frequent than Butler's selective use
**Key matches:** Latin names used consistently (Ulysses, Minerva, Jove, Telemachus); No archaic forms or inversions; natural SVO and modern verbs ('you are very welcome'); Brisk active voice with Victorian connectives ('for,' 'so') and practical god descriptions; Dialogue in earnest, stiff Victorian style matching Telemachus' character

**Known translation (Samuel Butler (1900)):**
> And Ulysses answered, “King Alcinous, it is a good thing to hear a bard
with such a divine voice as this man has. There is nothing better or
more delightful than when a whole people make merry together, with the
guests sitting orderly to listen, while the table is loaded with bread
and meats, and the cup-bearer draws wine and fills his cup for every
man. This is indeed as fair a sight as a man can see. Now, however,
since you are inclined to ask the story of my sorrows, and rekindle my
own sad memories in respect of them, I do not know how to begin, nor
yet how to continue and conclude my tale, for the hand of heaven has
been laid heavily upon me.

“Firstly, then, I will tell you my name that you too may know it, and
one day, if I outlive this time of sorrow, may become my guests though
I live so far away from all of you. I am Ulysses son of Laertes,
renowned among mankind for all manner of subtlety, so that my fame
ascends to heaven. I live in Ithaca, where there is a high mountain
called Neritum, covered with forests; and not far from it there is a
group of islands very near to one another—Dulichium, Same, and the
wooded island of Zacynthus. It lies squat on the horizon, all highest
up in the sea towards the sunset, while the others lie away from it
towards dawn.75 It is a rugged island, but it breeds brave men, and my
eyes know none that they better love to look upon. The goddess Calypso
kept me with her in her cave, and wanted me to marry her, as did also
the cunning Aeaean goddess Circe; but they could neither of them
persuade me, for there is nothing dearer to a man than his own country
and his parents, and however splendid a home he may have in a foreign
country, if it be far from father or mother, he does not care about it.
Now, however, I will tell you of the many hazardous adventures which by
Jove’s will I met with on my return from Troy.

**Pipeline output:**
> I know nothing better than this at a feast—when the whole town is merry, and the banqueters sit in order down the halls listening to the singer, while the tables beside them are full of bread and roast meats, and the cup-bearer draws wine from the mixing-bowl and carries it round pouring into the cups. This seems to me the finest thing in the world. But you set your heart on asking about my grievous cares, that I might groan still more deeply. What shall I tell you first, and what last—for the gods in heaven have given me many woes? I will begin with my name, so that you too may know it, and then if I escape this pitiless day I can be your guest though I live far from home. I am Ulysses, son of Laertes, famed among all men for my wiles, and my fame has reached heaven. I live in clear-seen Ithaca. There is a mountain on it, Neritum, covered with forest and conspicuous from afar. Many islands lie close together round about it, Dulichium and Same and wooded Zacynthus. Ithaca itself lies low, farthest out to sea towards the darkness, while the others face the dawn and sun; it is rough, but a good nurse of youths. I know no other land more lovely to behold. There Calypso the nymph held me in her hollow caves, longing to make me her husband; and Circe in the same way held me in her halls on Aeaea, longing to make me her husband; but they never won the heart within my breast. Nothing is sweeter than one's country and parents—not even if one dwells far away in a rich house on foreign soil remote from one's parents. Come then, and I will tell you of my grievous homecoming, wherewith Jove visited me as I came from Troy. The wind that bore me from Ilium brought me first to the Cicones.

**Rationale:** The pipeline output closely mirrors Butler's clear, brisk Victorian prose with medium-length active sentences, natural dialogue, selective epithets (e.g., 'wooded Zacynthus'), and precise use of Latin names like Ulysses and Jove. It maintains readability and a matter-of-fact tone, with naturalistic treatment of gods and geography descriptions that echo Butler's phrasing (e.g., 'rough, but a good nurse of youths' parallels 'rugged island, but it breeds brave men'). Minor deviations include omitting the opening address to Alcinous and bard praise, slightly more literal phrasing in transitions, and extending beyond the ground truth passage.

**Key gaps:** Omits Ulysses' direct response to King Alcinous and praise of the bard's 'divine voice'; Slightly more literal in woe introduction ('What shall I tell you first...') vs. Butler's interpretive 'I do not know how to begin'; Extends passage with Cicones reference not in ground truth
**Key matches:** Perfect Latin names (Ulysses, Jove, Calypso, Circe) and zero archaism (modern 'you', standard SVO); Victorian connectives and rhythm ('Come then, and I will tell...') with compound sentences via 'and', 'while', 'but'; Selective vivid details ('clear-seen Ithaca', 'hollow caves') without mechanical epithets; Naturalistic dialogue and brisk narrative flow matching samples

> The nymph, obedient to divine command,
To seek Ulysses, paced along the sand,
Him pensive on the lonely beach she found,
With streaming eyes in briny torrents drown’d,
And inly pining for his native shore;
For now the soft enchantress pleased no more;
For now, reluctant, and constrained by charms,
Absent he lay in her desiring arms,
In slumber wore the heavy night away,
On rocks and shores consumed the tedious day;
There sate all desolate, and sighed alone,
With echoing sorrows made the mountains groan.
And roll’d his eyes o’er all the restless main,
Till, dimmed with rising grief, they streamed again.

> She went her way, for now she hearkened to the messages of Zeus. And there she found him sitting on the shore, and his eyes were never dry of tears, and his sweet life was ebbing away as he mourned for his return; for the nymph no more found favour in his sight. Howsoever by night he would sleep by her, as needs he must, in the hollow caves, unwilling lover by a willing lady. And in the day-time he would sit on the rocks and on the beach, straining his soul with tears, and groans, and griefs, and through his tears he would look wistfully over the unharvested deep. And standing nigh she spake to him, goddess divine: 'Cease thou from sorrowing, and weary not thy heart any more here, neither let thy life waste away; for lo, now will I send thee hence right speedily. But come, cut long timbers and fit them cunningly with bronze to a broad raft, and set up mast and yard thereon aloft, that it may bear thee over the misty deep. And I will put therein bread and water and dark-red sweet wine, to ward off hunger from thee, and clothe thee in raiment; and I will send a following wind, that thou mayest come all unscathed to thy native land, if haply it be the will of the gods who hold the wide heaven, who are far wiser than I to devise and to fulfil.' So spake she, and the patient Odysseus shuddered, and answered her and spake winged words: 'Goddess, methinks thou hast some other thing in mind herein, and art not minded to send me forth in earnest, seeing thou biddest me cross on a raft the great gulf of the sea, dread and grievous; for not even swift-faring ships can make it, rejoicing in the wind of Zeus. Nor would I of myself go aboard a raft, loth as I am, unless thou, goddess, wilt swear me a great oath that thou art not devising against me some other evil.'

**Rationale:** The pipeline output is virtually indistinguishable from Butcher & Lang's style, directly matching their provided sample verbatim for Od. 5.151-160 while extending seamlessly in the same archaic prose, paratactic structure, and formulaic elements. It consistently deploys high archaism (thou/thee, spake, methinks, biddest, loth), Greek names, full epithets ('patient Odysseus,' 'winged words'), particles ('lo,' 'haply,' 'howsoever'), and solemn narration of divine action. No modernisms or deviations disrupt the KJV-like elevated register and hypotactic chaining.

**Key matches:** Exact verbatim match to Butcher & Lang Od. 5.151-160 sample; Perfect archaic second-person (thou/thee/thy) and verbs (spake, biddest, hearkened); Full epithets preserved ('patient Odysseus,' 'winged words'); Paratactic chaining with 'and,' 'for,' particles ('lo,' 'haply,' 'howsoever'); Greek names (Zeus, Odysseus), formal elevated tone, no editorializing of supernatural

Climb the tall bark, and launch into the main;
At once the mast we rear, at once unbind
The spacious sheet, and stretch it to the wind;
Then pale and pensive stand, with cares oppress’d,
And solemn horror saddens every breast.
A freshening breeze the magic power supplied,
While the wing’d vessel flew along the tide;
Our oars we shipp’d; all day the swelling sails
Full from the guiding pilot catch’d the gales.

“Now sunk the sun from his aërial height,
And o’er the shaded billows rush’d the night;
When lo! we reach’d old Ocean’s utmost bounds,
Where rocks control his waves with ever-during mounds.

“There in a lonely land, and gloomy cells,
The dusky nation of Cimmeria dwells;
The sun ne’er views the uncomfortable seats,
When radiant he advances, or retreats:
Unhappy race! whom endless night invades,
Clouds the dull air, and wraps them round in shades.

“The ship we moor on these obscure abodes;
Disbark the sheep, an offering to the gods;
And, hellward bending, o’er the beach descry
The doleful passage to the infernal sky.
The victims, vow’d to each Tartarian power,
Eurylochus and Perimedes bore.

> And we fared onward grieving sore, and pouring tears plenteous. And behind us the dark-prowed ship sent a fair following breeze, good comrade, Circe fair-tressed, dread goddess that soundeth afar. We ourselves, having stowed every weapon aboard the ship, sate us down; and wind and steersman guided her. All day long her sails were stretched as she fared over the sea; and the sun sank, and all roadways grew shadowy. And she came to the bounds of deep-flowing Oceanus. Lo, there the folk and city of Cimmerian men, shrouded in mist and cloud; nor ever doth the sun bright-shining look down upon them with his beams, neither whensoever he betaketh him to starry heaven, nor whensoever again from heaven he turneth toward earth, but howbeit ruinous night is stretched continually over wretched mortals. Anon arriving there, we beached the ship, and took forth the sheep; and we ourselves walked again beside the stream of Oceanus, until we came to the place whereof Circe had told us. There Perimedes and Eurylochus held the victims; but I, drawing my sharp sword from beside my thigh, digged a pit a cubit each way, this way and that, and poured a drink-offering round about to all the dead, first with honey-sweet mead, next with sweet wine, and thirdly with water; and thereon sprinkled white barley meal. And much I besought the feeble heads of the dead, vowing that when I came to Ithaca I would sacrifice a barren heifer, the best I had, in my halls, and would heap the pyre with goodly gear, and apart from all to Tiresias alone would sacrifice a ram all-black, excelling all our sheep.

**Rationale:** The pipeline output captures Butcher & Lang's archaic prose register exceptionally well, with consistent high archaism (e.g., 'doth', 'betaketh', 'sate us down'), liberal use of particles ('Lo', 'howbeit', 'Anon'), paratactic chaining of clauses via 'and'/'but'/'nor', and faithful preservation of epithets ('dark-prowed ship', 'fair-tressed' Circe, 'deep-flowing Oceanus') and formulaic ritual details. Greek names and solemn narrative tone align perfectly, reading like a KJV-inflected Homeric document. Minor deviations include slightly fewer particles than in samples and occasional phrasing that feels a touch less incantatory, preventing a perfect 10.

**Key gaps:** Slightly sparser deployment of particles like 'Yea' or 'Wherefore' compared to samples; Rhythm occasionally less rigidly dactylic/incantatory in clause chaining
**Key matches:** Full preservation of epithets and Homeric formulas (e.g., ritual pit-digging and libations verbatim); Paratactic structure with long, coordinated sentences mirroring Greek hypotaxis; Archaic verbs and vocabulary (e.g., 'fared', 'grieving sore', 'plenteous', 'besought'); Greek names (Oceanus, Perimedes, Eurylochus) and neutral divine treatment

Why is she silent, while her son is nigh?

Whomsoever of the dead who have perished thou shalt suffer to draw near the blood, he shall speak to thee all true; but from whomsoever thou shalt withhold it, he shall go back again. So spake the soul and went within the house of Hades, lord Tiresias, for that he had spoken according to the fates. But I abode there steadfast, until my mother came nigh and drank of the black blood: anon she knew me, and wailing spake unto me winged words: My son, how hast thou come beneath the misty gloom of Hades, being alive? Hard it is for the living to behold these things; for midway be great rivers and dread streams, first Ocean, over which there is no way for a man afoot, save he have a well-wrought ship. Art thou now come hither from Troy, wandering, with ship and company, after long time? nor hast thou yet come to Achaea, nor set foot upon thine own land, nor seen thy wife within her halls? So spake she; but I made answer and spake unto her: Howbeit, my mother, need hath brought me down to the house of Hades, to seek the soul of Tiresias the Theban lord; for not yet have I drawn nigh the land of Achaea, nor set foot upon mine own country, but ever sorrowful have I wandered, since first I followed divine Agamemnon unto steed-nurturing Ilios, that we might fight with the Trojans. But come now, tell me this and declare it truly: what fate of long-drawn death subdued thee? was it lingering sickness, or did Artemis the shaft-bearing slay thee with her gentle shafts, coming upon thee? And tell me of father and of son whom I left behind: doth mine honour yet abide with them, or hath some other man it already, affirming that I return no more?

**Rationale:** The pipeline output captures Butcher & Lang's archaic KJV-like prose exceptionally well, with consistent use of particles (Lo, Yea, anon, Howbeit), inverted syntax, paratactic chaining ('and,' 'nor,' 'but'), formulaic phrases ('so spake,' 'winged words'), and epithets ('shaft-bearing,' 'steed-nurturing Ilios'). It preserves Greek names, solemn tone for the supernatural, and verbatim-like repetitions. Minor deviations include slightly less ubiquitous archaism in some verbs and occasional shorter sentences deviating from ideal hypotactic length.

**Key gaps:** Verb archaism not fully consistent (e.g., 'suffer' and 'behold' good, but 'came nigh' could be more intensified like 'drew nigh');; Fewer particles in some clauses than samples' liberal deployment;; Sentences occasionally shorter than the target’s characteristic 4-8 clause chains.
**Key matches:** Perfect preservation of epithets and formulas: 'winged words,' 'lord Tiresias,' 'divine Agamemnon';; Archaic second-person in direct address: 'thy heart,' 'hast thou,' 'Art thou';; Paratactic structure and particles mirror samples exactly: 'So spake I, and he straightway answered and spake';; Greek names and patronymic flavor: 'Tiresias the Theban lord,' 'Achaea,' 'Ilios'.

> The assembly thus the sire supreme address’d,
AEgysthus’ fate revolving in his breast,
Whom young Orestes to the dreary coast
Of Pluto sent, a blood-polluted ghost.

“Perverse mankind! whose wills, created free,
Charge all their woes on absolute degree;
All to the dooming gods their guilt translate,
And follies are miscall’d the crimes of fate.
When to his lust AEgysthus gave the rein,
Did fate, or we, the adulterous act constrain?
Did fate, or we, when great Atrides died,
Urge the bold traitor to the regicide?
Hermes I sent, while yet his soul remain’d
Sincere from royal blood, and faith profaned;
To warn the wretch, that young Orestes, grown
To manly years, should re-assert the throne.
Yet, impotent of mind, and uncontroll’d,
He plunged into the gulf which Heaven foretold.”

**Pipeline output:**
> Then Orestes, far-famed son of Agamemnon, slew him: thereof making mention, he spake winged words among the immortals: 'Lo, how mortals blame the gods! For they say that from us come woes, but they themselves by their own follies have sorrows beyond their fate, even as now Aegisthus hath wedded beyond fate the wedded wife of Atreus' son, and hath slain him on his returning, witting the grim destruction; for we ourselves told him aforetime, sending Hermes, the clear-sighted slayer of Argos, neither to slay him nor to woo the wife: for from Orestes shall come vengeance for Atreus' son, whensoever he shall reach manhood and yearn for his own land. Thus spake Hermes, but he persuaded not the heart of Aegisthus, of good intent: and now hath he paid all thereof at once.... Father Zeus our sire, Cronides, most high lord of kings, yea, and that man lieth now in a doom even like his deeds: yea, let another perish who doeth such things! But for me my heart doth grieve sore over Odysseus wise of heart, ill-fated, who far from his friends endureth woes manifold on a wave-girt isle, where is the navel of the sea; a wooded isle, and a goddess dwelleth in her halls therein, daughter of Atlas evil-minded, who knoweth all the depths of the whole sea, and himself holdeth the tall pillars that keep earth and heaven asunder. His daughter holdeth back the hapless one lamenting, and ever with soft and wheedling words she charmeth him, that he may forget Ithaca: but Odysseus, yearning to behold, if haply he might see the smoke arising from his own land, longeth to die. Nay, not even to thee 'per'

**Rationale:** The pipeline output captures Butcher & Lang's archaic prose style exceptionally well, with consistent high archaism (spake, hath, endureth, charmeth), liberal particles (Lo, yea), full epithet preservation ('winged words', 'slayer of Argos'), Greek names, and paratactic chaining of clauses mirroring Greek hypotaxis. It reads like a plausible excerpt from their translation, solemn and formulaic. Minor deviations include an extra 'clear-sighted' modifier on Hermes not standard in their usage, 'wise of heart' for Odysseus (slightly off their rotated epithets like 'patient' or 'of many devices'), and an incomplete final sentence.

**Key gaps:** 'Clear-sighted' added to 'slayer of Argos' for Hermes, not matching their consistent plain 'slayer of Argos'; 'Odysseus wise of heart' deviates slightly from their specific epithet rotations (e.g., 'patient Odysseus'); Abruptly incomplete ending ('Nay, not even to thee 'per') disrupts formulaic verbatim preservation
**Key matches:** Perfect 'spake winged words' formula verbatim; Archaic particles and inversions: 'Lo, how mortals...', 'yea, and that man...'; Paratactic long sentences with 'for', 'but', 'and': e.g., chained clauses on Aegisthus's fate; Greek names and patronymics: Odysseus, Aegisthus, Atreus' son, Cronides; Full simile-like descriptions (e.g., Atlas's daughter) with gravity and no compression

> Then thus Ulysses: “Thou whom first in sway,
As first in virtue, these thy realms obey;
How sweet the products of a peaceful reign!
The heaven-taught poet and enchanting strain;
The well-filled palace, the perpetual feast,
A land rejoicing, and a people bless’d!
How goodly seems it ever to employ
Man’s social days in union and in joy;
The plenteous hoard high-heap’d with cates divine,
And o’er the foaming bowl the laughing wine!

“Amid these joys, why seeks thy mind to know
The unhappy series of a wanderer’s woe?
Rememberance sad, whose image to review,
Alas, I must open all my wounds anew!
And oh, what first, what last shall I relate,
Of woes unnumbered sent by Heaven and Fate?

“Know first the man (though now a wretch distress’d)
Who hopes thee, monarch, for his future guest.
Behold Ulysses! no ignoble name,
Earth sounds my wisdom and high heaven my fame.

“My native soil is Ithaca the fair,
Where high Neritus waves his woods in air;
Dulichium, Same and Zaccynthus crown’d
With shady mountains spread their isles around.
(These to the north and night’s dark regions run,
Those to Aurora and the rising sun).
Low lies our isle, yet bless’d in fruitful stores;
Strong are her sons, though rocky are her shores;
And none, ah none no lovely to my sight,
Of all the lands that heaven o’erspreads with light.
In vain Calypso long constrained my stay,
With sweet, reluctant, amorous delay;
With all her charms as vainly Circe strove,
And added magic to secure my love.
In pomps or joys, the palace or the grot,
My country’s image never was forgot;
My absent parents rose before my sight,
And distant lay contentment and delight.

> For I deem no fairer close than when mirth possesseth all the people throughout the city, and feasters hearken in the halls to the minstrel, sitting in due order; Lo, beside them tables brim with bread and roasted meats, and the cup-bearer draweth wine from the bowl and beareth it in the pitchers, filling the cups therewith: this in my heart seemeth to me the very fairest. But thy heart turned thee to ask of my sorrows, that I, groaning the more, might sigh: what first, what last shall I tell thereof? Many woes have the gods of heaven given me. Now first of all will I declare my name, that ye too may know it, and I thereafter, having escaped the pitiless day, be a stranger and guest to you, far from my dwelling. I am ODYSSEUS, SON OF LAERTES, who am in men's minds for all manner of wiles, and my fame reaches unto heaven. And I dwell in clear-seen Ithaca, wherein is a mountain Neriton, with trembling forest leaves, standing manifest to view, and many islands lie around, very near one to the other, Dulichium and Same, and wooded Zacynthus. Now Ithaca lies low, furthest up the sea-line toward the darkness, but those others face the dawning and the sun: a rugged isle, but a good nurse of noble youths; and for myself I can see nought beside sweeter than a man's own country. Yea, there divine Calypso held me fast in her hollow caves, wooing me that I should be her lord; and even so Circe of Aeaea, the guileful, stayed me in her halls, wooing me that I should be her lord: howbeit they never won my heart within my breast. Thus naught sweeter becometh than one's fatherland and parents, yea, though one dwell in a rich house on a strange soil, far from his parents. But come, I will tell thee also of my return, fraught with woes, which Zeus vouchsafed me from Troy, wending thence. Out of Ilios the wind bare me and brought me nigh unto the Cicones.

**Rationale:** The pipeline output captures Butcher & Lang's archaic prose style exceptionally well, with consistent high archaism (thee/thy/ye, possesseth/draweth/harken), liberal particles (Lo, Yea, howbeit), paratactic chaining of clauses, Greek names/patronymics, and verbatim reproduction of the formulaic Ithaca self-introduction from their Od. 9 sample. It maintains elevated formality, solemn narration of divine elements (divine Calypso, Zeus), and full fidelity to Homeric formulas without compression. Minor gaps in particle density and exact verb choices (e.g., 'deem' vs. more biblical 'ween') prevent a perfect 10, but it could easily be mistaken for their work.

**Key gaps:** Slightly lower density of archaic particles compared to samples (e.g., fewer 'anon' or 'wherefore'); Verb forms solid but not always maximally inverted or biblical (e.g., 'turned thee to ask' vs. potential 'prompted thee'); No fixed epithets in this passage to test full preservation, though 'divine Calypso' and 'guileful' Circe align well
**Key matches:** Verbatim match to B&L Od. 9.19-28 Ithaca description, including 'clear-seen Ithaca' and exact phrasing; Archaic second-person (thy/thee/ye) and third-person verbs (possesseth, draweth, beareth) used without fail; Paratactic structure with chained 'and/but/yet' clauses mirroring Greek hypotaxis; Greek names (ODYSSEUS SON OF LAERTES, Dulichium, Zacynthus, Ilios, Cicones) and formulaic repetitions preserved; Particles (Lo, Yea, howbeit) and elevated KJV-like diction (harken, brim, vouchsafed) throughout

From all denial. Back supine lean'd he;
Fell flat; thick-necked then snor'd th' impious boar,
All-subduing Sleep seiz'd fast th' o'erthrown gore.
From jaws dark wine stream'd forth, and manly gasps
Brake out; wine-gorg'd he belch'd; vast ribs did gasp
And quake. Then I, much-skill'd Laertiades,
The fire-hard stake 'gainst ash-bed thrust, to seize
Heat from thick embers, till flames warm'd it well:
My much-enduring comrades chear'd I, fell
No whit to coward flight. But when olive-wood
Glow'd green yet fierce, red thro' the mass that stood,
From fire's hot womb I bore it nearer prest,
Comrades in circle; god-like heart possest
Great plume divine. They caught stout stake's keen end,
Deep in th' eye thrust; I leaning o'er did rend
And whirl, as mastwright wields his augur-drill
To bore stout beam; mates underneath with skill
Strap seiz'd both sides and turn'd; it ever ran
True course unwearied. So the fire-hot span
Of stake we whirl'd about his eye; warm blood
Stream'd; lids and brows hot vapours round did shroud,
Eye-roots with flaming death burnt deep and bound.
As smith massy axe or hatchet-head doth drown
In chill flood, hissing loud to 'suage the rage
Of iron, forge-fires leap, seas vainly 'gage:
So hiss'd his orb about th' olive gauge.
Dreadful he groan'd; high rock with echo shook,
We trembling shrunk; from gore-clogg'd eye he hook'd
Th' impaled stake forth, ruthless hands did fling
Far off unshackled. Then to Cyclops rang
His cry, that neighboured in wind-cavern'd holds.
They flock'd, night loaden; round the cave fast folds,
Ask'd: 'What woe rends thee, Polyphemus, ho,
Thro' ambrosial night? Sleepless thou mak'st us so?
Drives any man thy flocks 'gainst will away?
Or slays with guile, or forceth might in fray?'
Puissant Polypheme from cave made greet:
'O friends, Nobody slays me with guile nor feat
Of brawn!' ... 
But if no force thy god-like thews constrain,
No Jove-bred pain from great Jove's bolt is ta'en,
To cloud-gath'ring Neptune, sire, pray thou.
So went they; glad laugh'd my bold heart e'en now,
How feign'd name Outis and flaw'd wit's clear sleight
Deceiv'd them all—O Reason's triumph bright,
Soul's home by virtue's edge o'er vice victorious!

**Rationale:** The output captures Chapman's spirit through dense archaisms, inverted syntax, compound epithets, Latin/patronymic names, moral appraisal, and expanded similes, with complex enjambed syntax evoking his breathless style. However, it fundamentally fails the mandatory heroic couplets due to inconsistent and often absent rhymes (e.g., free/he, gasps/gasp, well/fell), disrupting the audible rhyming structure central to Chapman's form. Minor scansion issues and occasional modern phrasing prevent higher fidelity.

**Key gaps:** Inconsistent rhymes, violating the required aa bb heroic couplets (e.g., free/he, seize/well, wood/stood); Some lines lack iambic pentameter scansion or feel prose-like amid rhyme failures; Uses 'Nobody' instead of Chapman's 'No-Man' for Outis
**Key matches:** Dense Elizabethan archaisms and inversions (e.g., 'snor'd th' impious boar', 'Brake out'); Invented compound epithets (e.g., 'much-skill'd Laertiades', 'much-enduring comrades'); Latin names and patronymics (Laertiades, cloud-gath'ring Neptune, Jove); Added moral commentary (e.g., 'O Reason's triumph bright... victorious!'); Expanded similes (e.g., mastwright augur-drill and smith's forge, both amplified beyond Greek)

> Ulysses thus resolv’d the king’s demands:
“Alcinous, in whom this empire stands,
You should not of so natural right disherit
Your princely feast, as take from it the spirit.
To hear a poet, that in accent brings
The Gods’ breasts down, and breathes them as he sings,
Is sweet, and sacred; nor can I conceive,
In any common-weal, what more doth give
Note of the just and blessed empery,
Than to see comfort universally
Cheer up the people, when in ev’ry roof
She gives observers a most human proof
Of men’s contents. To see a neighbour’s feast
Adorn it through; and thereat hear the breast
Of the divine Muse; men in order set;
A wine-page waiting; tables crown’d with meat,
Set close to guests that are to use it skill’d;
The cup-boards furnish’d, and the cups still fill’d;
This shows, to my mind, most humanely fair.

And banqueters in huge halls their order lends
To th' heav'nly singer, thron'd in due array,
Who sweetly chants the Muse's songlings gay;
Beside them tables heap'd with finest bread,
And store of savoury roasts, all daintily spread;
While from th' mix'd massive-footed crater's womb
The wine-bearer with flowing flaggons come
Ambrosial sweets to pour, and shares to all the beakers

Where Neritus doth lift his shade-thron'd side,
Earth-shaking hill; and round her confines fill
Full many islands, peopled, lying still
Close-pinion'd each to other, tasting bread
Beneath mine empire; Dulichium hath spread,
And Samus, Zacynthus fraught with woodland brood.
But Ithaca herself, low-lying, rude,
Out-most in sea toward the duskie west is flung,
The rest toward dawn and Phoebus' beams are sprung,
All harsh and high, yet youth-nurse passing brave;
No soil more sweet my much-travail'd eyes have grave.
There glorious Calypsò, bright goddess-train'd,
Detain'd me in her archèd caverns chain'd,
Desirous I her spousal rites should prove;
So Circe witch'd me in her vaulted grove,
Ææa subtle-soul'd, fain my love to win:
But ne'er dissolv'd they my much-enduring skin
Within my breast heroic. O vice's fire,
Steadfast virtue withstood their Syren ire!
Nor aught so sweet as native soile and sires,
Though one in alien earths far-off respire
From parents far remov'd. But come, my much-bemoan'd
Return (which cloud-gath'ring Jove from Ilion fann'd)
I'll sing, me thence convey'd; winds to Cicones
Did drive my fleet o'er Neptune's vasty zones.

**Rationale:** The pipeline output captures Chapman's heroic couplets with consistent rhyming and enjambment, deploys accurate Latin names, patronymics, and invented compound epithets like 'city-razer Laertiades' and 'cloud-gath'ring Jove,' and inserts moral appraisal on virtue versus vice in true Chapman fashion. It closely mirrors the self-introduction passage's content and structure while amplifying with philosophical weight. Minor deviations include occasional metric irregularities, less densely archaic vocabulary and inversions than Chapman's labyrinthine style, and a few less elevated phrasings.

**Key gaps:** Meter occasionally slips from strict iambic pentameter (e.g., 'While from th' mix'd massive-footed crater's womb' is overcrowded); Archaic density lower—fewer forced contractions (th', t') or pervasive inversions like Chapman's 'Wound with his wisdom'; some modern echoes in 'savoury roasts' or 'songlings gay'; Syntax complex but not always as cumulatively breathless or parenthetically interrupted as Chapman's long-running sentences; Awkward rhymes/phrasing like 'beakers / seekers' or 'sigh and knell' feel less polished than Chapman's oratorical urgency
**Key matches:** Perfect heroic couplets with enjambment across verse paragraphs; Spot-on epithets: 'city-razer Laertiades,' 'much-enduring skin,' 'shade-thron'd side,' 'earth-shaking hill'; Moral editorializing: 'O vice's fire, / Steadfast virtue withstood their Syren ire!' echoes Chapman's 'O men unwise' insertions; Latin names and geography match exactly (Ulysses, Laertiades, Neritus, Dulichium, etc.); Elevated Elizabethan register with 'th',' ye,' 'ruthlesse,' 'duskie,' and philosophical close on native soil as soul's home

**Known translation (George Chapman (1616)):**
> I first inform’d them, that we were to fly
The heav’nly-singing Sirens’ harmony,
And flow’r-adorned meadow; and that I
Had charge to hear their song, but fetter’d fast
In bands, unfavour’d, to th’ erected mast,
From whence, if I should pray, or use command,
To be enlarg’d, they should with much more band
Contain my strugglings. This I simply told
To each particular, nor would withhold
What most enjoin’d mine own affection’s stay,
That theirs the rather might be taught t’ obey.

**Pipeline output:**
> She charg'd me thus; and list'ning I obey'd,
But strait they bound me fast with ropes array'd,
Upright to mast in hard restraint they rear'd,
That firm I there might stand, fixt and unfeard;
From thence the tacklings forth they drew and strain'd,
But if I begg'd release, or voice attain'd,
Then more with cords they should me bind and press,
And double my affliction in distress.
Thus all I told my mates in order due:
Meantime our goodly ship with speed did thwrough
The swelling seas attain Sirens' craggy shore,
For fair auspicious gale that still did pour;
Anon the wind ceas'd, and calm seas arose,
A wave-calming god the billows did compose
To rest, and smooth'd the main with hallow'd hand.
My bold companions rose, and straight did stand,
Furl'd down the sails, and in the concave bark
Depos'd them safe; then to their benches hark,
And whit'ning waters with their oars did chase.
But I a mighty wheel of wax did take,
With sharp bronze cut in small parts by strong hand,
And kneaded till it soften'd where I spann'd;
The cloud-gath'ring Sun, great Hyperion's beam,
With fervent rays anon the wax did gleam
And mollify; which strait to each mate's ear
I duly did apply, their sense to steer
From honey-sweet deceit of sirens' lure.
They bound me then in ship, hands, feet secure,
Upright unto the mast; from thence withall
The ropes they strain'd; themselves sate down, and small
The hoary sea with sinewy strokes did ply.
But when as far we went as voice on high
Of shouter sounds, that chase with eager cry,
Our swift ship near the honey-voic'd pass'd by,
Nor scap'd their ken; shrill accents they let fly:
"Come hither, fam'd Ulysses Laertiades,
Great glory of Achaians, city-razer's praise;
Thy bark make fast, and list our voice divine,
Fair, wondrous rare, none such hath heard ere thine!
For never man yet sail'd this sable sea,
But heard our song, and glad more knowing flee;
More wise, with knowledge heav'n and earth bestows.
We know all Troy's wide woes, where Argives rose
'Gainst Trojans by Jove's will, and suff'rings bore;
We know what'er on broad earth comes, and more."
O wise restraint o'er sense's rash desire,
That virtue's sacred fire doth thus aspire!
O folly chain'd by reason's holy bands,
That soul from tempter's gulf secure withstands!
Strait Perimedes then, and Eurylochus,
Arose, and more in bonds me held thus,
With greater pressure did my suff'rings close.
But when those rocks we past, no more arose
Sirenian voice or song; anon my friends
The wax from ears remov'd, which there attends,
And loos'd me from my bands. But when the isle
We left, anon we saw smoke, waves, turmoil;
Mighty surge heard, and dread tumultuous roar:
From trembling hands the oars all clatter'd o'er,
Fell in the stream; the ship her course forbore,
And there she stay'd.

**Rationale:** The pipeline output captures Chapman's spirit through dense Elizabethan archaisms, inverted syntax, hyphenated epithets like 'cloud-gath'ring Sun' and 'honey-voic'd', Latin names including 'Ulysses Laertiades', and especially the inserted moral commentary praising restraint and virtue, which is a hallmark of his allegorical approach. It employs mostly rhyming iambic pentameter couplets with enjambment and expands the wax simile effectively. Minor deviations in rhyme consistency (e.g., 'due/thwrough', 'chase/take') and occasional scansion issues prevent a perfect match but do not undermine the overall Chapman-esque style.

**Key gaps:** Inconsistent rhymes in several couplets (e.g., 'due/thwrough the swelling seas', 'chase/But I a mighty wheel'), weakening the mandatory heroic couplet form; Odd word 'thwrough' (likely typo for 'through'), disrupting archaic fluency; Some lines stretch meter slightly beyond strict pentameter
**Key matches:** Dense archaisms and inversions: 'charg'd me thus', 'strait they bound', 'anon the wind ceas'd'; Hyphenated epithets: 'cloud-gath'ring Sun', 'wave-calming god', 'honey-voic'd'; Moral appraisal insert: 'O wise restraint... soul from tempter's gulf secure withstands!'; Latin names and patronymics: 'Ulysses Laertiades', 'Jove'; Expanded simile on wax with Homeric expansion via sun's rays; Complex, enjambed syntax in verse paragraphs

> The man, O Muse, inform, that many a way[1]
Wound with his wisdom to his wished stay;
That wander’d wondrous far, when he the town
Of sacred Troy had sack’d and shiver’d down;
The cities of a world of nations,
With all their manners, minds, and fashions,
He saw and knew; at sea felt many woes,
Much care sustain’d, to save from overthrows
Himself and friends in their retreat for home;
But so their fates he could not overcome,
Though much he thirsted it. O men unwise,
They perish’d by their own impieties!
That in their hunger’s rapine would not shun
The oxen of the lofty-going Sun,
Who therefore from their eyes the day bereft
Of safe return. These acts, in some part left,
Tell us, as others, deified Seed of Jove.

**Pipeline output:**
> Who both his soul denied, and safe return to shore,
Yet could not save his friends, though for their lives he bore
Much thirst and travail: they by their own follies dead,
Rash fools, devour'd the beeves of lofty-going Sun,
Whose beams their rashness chid, whence home-return from eyes bereft anon.
O rash unhallowed men unwise, sun-bereft!
By their own crimes unblest, they perish'd then!
Thence, grey-eyed goddess, Jove's bright daughter, tell the rest.

There all the rest, who scap'd the steepy flight of death,
Were safe at home arriv'd, fled war's grim rage and sea's foul breath:
Him only, widow'd of return and wife, the nymph divine,
Potent Calypso held in hollow caves, with heart divine
To shine as his true spouse, nor ever loose her prey from doom.
But when the year had wheel'd its circling course in season's bloom,
The gods resolv'd his home-fate to Ithaca's blest bay;
Yet there not free from toils, nor 'mongst friends' loves to stay.

The Immortals pitied all, save cloud-gath'ring Neptune's spleen,
Who still with endless wrath 'gainst much-enduring Laertiades did lean,
Till he his wishéd earth should win. But he, far thence did fare
'Twixt dark-eyed Ethiop folk, earth's utmost men, earths-border there
And here divided, where Hyperion sets, or skyward sends
His beams, which anon ascending thence ascends.

**Rationale:** The output captures Chapman's heroic couplets with consistent rhyming (mostly aa, bb), dense Elizabethan archaisms (e.g., 'anon', 'bereft', 'scap'd', 'perish'd'), inverted syntax, Latin names (Laertiades, Jove, Neptune), and invented epithets ('lofty-going Sun', 'cloud-gath'ring Neptune', 'much-enduring Laertiades'). Moral appraisals like 'Rash fools' and 'O rash unhallowed men unwise' echo Chapman's editorializing. Minor deviations in imperfect rhymes (e.g., dead/Sun), occasional metrical roughness, and slightly less labyrinthine syntax prevent a perfect match.

**Key gaps:** Imperfect or slant rhymes (e.g., dead/Sun, anon/bereft) disrupt Chapman's audible precision; Meter occasionally irregular or exceeds pentameter without clear alexandrine intent; Syntax complex but less cumulatively breathless and embedded than Chapman's 4-8 couplet run-ons; Abrupt start as continuation rather than self-contained verse paragraph
**Key matches:** Rhyming heroic couplets with enjambment across boundaries; Dense archaisms and inversions (e.g., 'they by their own follies dead'); Compound epithets forged in Chapman's style ('grey-eyed goddess', 'much-enduring Laertiades'); Moral commentary naming vice ('By their own crimes unblest'); Correct Latin names and patronymics

> Meanwhile my shag-hair'd comrades all the rest,
I bade with speed our well-trimm'd vessels breast,
Lest any tasting of the luscious lotus,

They straight embark'd, and on the benches sate,
In even order, smiting hoarèd state
Of brackish seas with polish'd oars; from thence
We further sail'd, deep-grieving to commence
Our woes, much-enduring in our hearts' sad parts:
To th' haughty Cyclops' lawless coasts imparts
Our ship; high-soul'd monsters, atheistical,
Who trusting Jove and deathless Pow'rs withal,
Yet plough no earth, nor with their hands do sow,
But all unsown, unplough'd, doth freely grow
Wheat, barley, vines with weight-burd'ned grapes that yield
Cluster'd rich wine, and Jove's rains make the field
Still teem with all-sufficiency. O brood
Impieus and savage! No council-martial throng
Of peers, nor rights of justice have they known;
But on high mountains' crowns they dwell alone
In hollow towns of archèd caves, where each
Rules as he lists his wife and child; nor reach
Neighbours mutual care or counsel; O profane,
From virtue dark, law divine in vain!
No huntsmen trace the woodland griefs, nor haunt
The mountain's face beasts following; no stint
Nor shame of flocks, nor tillage toucheth now
Their sight; but untilled, unsown, the island mourns
For lack of men, yet wilds with goats adorns,
Innumerous feeding with her milky store,
Since no broad-beakèd ships broad-sea-room bore
For Cyclops there, nor shipwrights cunning frame
Well-ribb'd tall vessels, that might win them fame
To cities, carrying things men change by sea;
Which had they such, their well-built isle might be
Famed far, naught lacking; pleasant meads outspread
Beside gray-salt ocean's flow'ry shores outlaid,
Soft-shady trees, vines luxuriant that grow
With heav'nly nurture's ever-ambrosial flow.
Good soil for plow; deep pasturage aye glads
The fallows thro' each age, so fat the sods
Beneath the dews of cloud-gath'ring Jove.
A harbour good, like soul's calm road from love
Of storms, where need no cable-strove to moor,
Nor anchors cast, nor stays the sterns secure,
But waiting till the sailors' mind and gales
Propitious breathe, there safe in roadstead sails.

**Rationale:** The pipeline output aligns well with Chapman's elevated archaic register, inventive compound epithets, moral editorializing, and expansive descriptive amplification, using Elizabethan grammar, inverted syntax, and iambic pentameter. It evokes the oratorical energy and philosophical weight of Chapman's moral allegory. However, the most critical constraint—strict rhyming heroic couplets—is inconsistently executed, with multiple non-rhyming or poorly paired lines disrupting the form.

**Key gaps:** Inconsistent rhyme scheme, with failures like 'atheistical/withal', 'brood/Impieus', and 'throng/known' breaking mandatory aa bb cc couplets; Some lines lack clear pentameter scansion or force awkward slant rhymes, deviating from Chapman's audible, enjambed but reliably rhymed verse paragraphs
**Key matches:** Dense archaisms and inversions (e.g., 'doth freely grow', 'hoarèd state', 'th' haughty Cyclops'); Compound epithets forged in Chapman's style (e.g., 'shag-hair'd', 'weight-burd'ned', 'cloud-gath'ring Jove'); Moral appraisals naming vice (e.g., 'O brood Impieus and savage! ... O profane, From virtue dark'); Latin names (Jove), complex embedded syntax, and verse-paragraph structure with enjambment
