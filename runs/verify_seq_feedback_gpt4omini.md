## Final Translation

Just as geographers, Sosius Senecio, fill the margins of their maps with lands beyond their knowledge—labeling them with notes like 'waterless sandy wastes full of wild beasts,' 'endless bog,' 'Scythian chill,' or 'frozen sea'—so too with my Parallel Lives: after covering eras reachable by sound reasoning and rooted in historical fact, it would be fitting to say of earlier times, 'Beyond lies a world of marvels and fictions, claimed by poets and myth-makers, with no credibility or clarity left.'

After publishing my account of Lycurgus the lawgiver and Numa the king, it seemed reasonable—now that my history had reached times close to Romulus—to include him as well. But as I pondered (in Aeschylus's words) for such a warrior—who will join battle? Whom shall I set against him? Who is reliable?—it struck me to pair the founder of beautiful and renowned Athens with the father of invincible and glorious Rome.

May we succeed in refining the mythical with reason, making it yield and assume the appearance of history. But wherever it defiantly scorns persuasion and refuses to blend with reason, we'll appeal to understanding readers who accept ancient accounts indulgently.

### Paragraph 1

ὥσπερ ἐν ταῖς γεωγραφίαις, ὦ Σόσσιε Σενεκίων, οἱ ἱστορικοὶ τὰ διαφεύγοντα τὴν γνῶσιν αὐτῶν τοῖς ἐσχάτοις μέρεσι τῶν πινάκων πιεζοῦντες, αἰτίας παραγράφουσιν ὅτι "τὰ δ᾽ ἐπέκεινα θῖνες ἄνυδροι καὶ θηριώδεις" ἢ "πηλὸς ἀϊδνὴς" ἢ "σκυθικὸν κρύος" ἢ "πέλαγος πεπηγός," οὕτως ἐμοὶ περὶ τὴν τῶν βίων τῶν παραλλήλων γραφήν, τὸν ἐφικτὸν εἰκότι λόγῳ καὶ βάσιμον ἱστορίᾳ πραγμάτων ἐχομένῃ χρόνον διελθόντι, περὶ τῶν ἀνωτέρω καλῶς εἶχεν εἰπεῖν· "τὰ δ᾽ ἐπέκεινα τερατώδη καὶ τραγικὰ ποιηταὶ καὶ μυθογράφοι νέμονται, καὶ οὐκέτ᾽ ἔχει πίστιν οὐδὲ σαφήνειαν."

### Paragraph 2

ἐπεὶ δὲ τὸν περὶ Λυκούργου τοῦ νομοθέτου καὶ Νομᾶ τοῦ βασιλέως λόγον ἐκδόντες, ἐδοκοῦμεν οὐκ ἂν ἀλόγως τῷ Ῥωμύλῳ προσαναβῆναι, πλησίον τῶν χρόνων αὐτοῦ τῇ ἱστορίᾳ γεγονότες, σκοποῦντι δέ μοι τοιῷδε φωτί (κατ᾽ Αἰσχύλον) τίς ξυμβήσεται; τίν᾽ ἀντιτάξω τῷδε; τίς φερέγγυος; ἐφαίνετο τὸν τῶν καλῶν καὶ ἀοιδίμων οἰκιστὴν Ἀθηνῶν ἀντιστῆσαι καὶ παραβαλεῖν τῷ πατρὶ τῆς ἀνικήτου καὶ μεγαλοδόξου Ῥώμης,

### Paragraph 3

εἴη μὲν οὖν ἡμῖν ἐκκαθαιρόμενον λόγῳ τὸ μυθῶδες ὑπακοῦσαι καὶ λαβεῖν ἱστορίας ὄψιν, ὅπου δ᾽ ἂν αὐθαδῶς τοῦ πιθανοῦ περιφρονῇ καὶ μὴ δέχηται τὴν πρὸς τὸ εἰκὸς μῖξιν, εὐγνωμόνων ἀκροατῶν δεησόμεθα καὶ πρᾴως τὴν ἀρχαιολογίαν προσδεχομένων.
