## Final Translation

Like mapmakers, Sosius Senecio, who push unknown places to the edges of their maps and add notes like "beyond are dry sandy deserts full of wild beasts," or "endless mud," or "Scythian cold," or "frozen sea," so in my book of paired lives, after covering times we can reach with good guesses and solid facts, I could say of the earlier times: "beyond are marvels and fictions. Poets and myth-makers live there. Nothing is believable or clear."

After we finished writing about Lycurgus, the man who made the laws, and King Numa, it made sense to add Romulus too. Our story had reached the time close to when he lived. But as I thought about this great hero (like Aeschylus says): Who will fight him? Who can I set against him? Who is good enough? It seemed right to compare the founder of beautiful and famous Athens with the father of unbeatable and glorious Rome.

I hope we can clean up the myths with clear thinking, so they obey it and look like history. But wherever they stubbornly scorn what's believable and refuse to mix with what's likely, we'll need kind listeners who gently welcome ancient stories.

### Paragraph 1

ὥσπερ ἐν ταῖς γεωγραφίαις, ὦ Σόσσιε Σενεκίων, οἱ ἱστορικοὶ τὰ διαφεύγοντα τὴν γνῶσιν αὐτῶν τοῖς ἐσχάτοις μέρεσι τῶν πινάκων πιεζοῦντες, αἰτίας παραγράφουσιν ὅτι "τὰ δ᾽ ἐπέκεινα θῖνες ἄνυδροι καὶ θηριώδεις" ἢ "πηλὸς ἀϊδνὴς" ἢ "σκυθικὸν κρύος" ἢ "πέλαγος πεπηγός," οὕτως ἐμοὶ περὶ τὴν τῶν βίων τῶν παραλλήλων γραφήν, τὸν ἐφικτὸν εἰκότι λόγῳ καὶ βάσιμον ἱστορίᾳ πραγμάτων ἐχομένῃ χρόνον διελθόντι, περὶ τῶν ἀνωτέρω καλῶς εἶχεν εἰπεῖν· "τὰ δ᾽ ἐπέκεινα τερατώδη καὶ τραγικὰ ποιηταὶ καὶ μυθογράφοι νέμονται, καὶ οὐκέτ᾽ ἔχει πίστιν οὐδὲ σαφήνειαν."

### Paragraph 2

ἐπεὶ δὲ τὸν περὶ Λυκούργου τοῦ νομοθέτου καὶ Νομᾶ τοῦ βασιλέως λόγον ἐκδόντες, ἐδοκοῦμεν οὐκ ἂν ἀλόγως τῷ Ῥωμύλῳ προσαναβῆναι, πλησίον τῶν χρόνων αὐτοῦ τῇ ἱστορίᾳ γεγονότες, σκοποῦντι δέ μοι τοιῷδε φωτί (κατ᾽ Αἰσχύλον) τίς ξυμβήσεται; τίν᾽ ἀντιτάξω τῷδε; τίς φερέγγυος; ἐφαίνετο τὸν τῶν καλῶν καὶ ἀοιδίμων οἰκιστὴν Ἀθηνῶν ἀντιστῆσαι καὶ παραβαλεῖν τῷ πατρὶ τῆς ἀνικήτου καὶ μεγαλοδόξου Ῥώμης,

### Paragraph 3

εἴη μὲν οὖν ἡμῖν ἐκκαθαιρόμενον λόγῳ τὸ μυθῶδες ὑπακοῦσαι καὶ λαβεῖν ἱστορίας ὄψιν, ὅπου δ᾽ ἂν αὐθαδῶς τοῦ πιθανοῦ περιφρονῇ καὶ μὴ δέχηται τὴν πρὸς τὸ εἰκὸς μῖξιν, εὐγνωμόνων ἀκροατῶν δεησόμεθα καὶ πρᾴως τὴν ἀρχαιολογίαν προσδεχομένων.
