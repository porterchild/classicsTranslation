## Final Translation

Mapmakers, dear Sosius Senecio, crowd the lands they don't know onto the edges of their maps. They add notes there: 'Beyond are sandy deserts without water, full of wild beasts,' or 'bottomless mud,' or 'Scythian cold,' or 'frozen sea.' It's the same with my book of matched lives. I've covered the times we can reach with clear reasoning and solid facts from history. For what lies even further back, it fits to say: 'There are strange marvels and tragic tales where poets and story-weavers dwell. Nothing true or clear remains.'

After we published our story about Lycurgus the lawmaker and King Numa, it made sense to include Romulus too, now that our history was close to his time. I wondered, like Aeschylus says about a great fighter, who could stand up to him? Who should I match him with? Who is good enough? I chose the founder of beautiful and famous Athens to compare with the father of unbeatable and glorious Rome.

May we clean myths with clear thinking, so they obey and look like real history. But wherever they stubbornly ignore what's believable and refuse to mix in anything likely, we will ask for kind listeners who gently welcome the old stories.

### Paragraph 1

ὥσπερ ἐν ταῖς γεωγραφίαις, ὦ Σόσσιε Σενεκίων, οἱ ἱστορικοὶ τὰ διαφεύγοντα τὴν γνῶσιν αὐτῶν τοῖς ἐσχάτοις μέρεσι τῶν πινάκων πιεζοῦντες, αἰτίας παραγράφουσιν ὅτι "τὰ δ᾽ ἐπέκεινα θῖνες ἄνυδροι καὶ θηριώδεις" ἢ "πηλὸς ἀϊδνὴς" ἢ "σκυθικὸν κρύος" ἢ "πέλαγος πεπηγός," οὕτως ἐμοὶ περὶ τὴν τῶν βίων τῶν παραλλήλων γραφήν, τὸν ἐφικτὸν εἰκότι λόγῳ καὶ βάσιμον ἱστορίᾳ πραγμάτων ἐχομένῃ χρόνον διελθόντι, περὶ τῶν ἀνωτέρω καλῶς εἶχεν εἰπεῖν· "τὰ δ᾽ ἐπέκεινα τερατώδη καὶ τραγικὰ ποιηταὶ καὶ μυθογράφοι νέμονται, καὶ οὐκέτ᾽ ἔχει πίστιν οὐδὲ σαφήνειαν."

### Paragraph 2

ἐπεὶ δὲ τὸν περὶ Λυκούργου τοῦ νομοθέτου καὶ Νομᾶ τοῦ βασιλέως λόγον ἐκδόντες, ἐδοκοῦμεν οὐκ ἂν ἀλόγως τῷ Ῥωμύλῳ προσαναβῆναι, πλησίον τῶν χρόνων αὐτοῦ τῇ ἱστορίᾳ γεγονότες, σκοποῦντι δέ μοι τοιῷδε φωτί (κατ᾽ Αἰσχύλον) τίς ξυμβήσεται; τίν᾽ ἀντιτάξω τῷδε; τίς φερέγγυος; ἐφαίνετο τὸν τῶν καλῶν καὶ ἀοιδίμων οἰκιστὴν Ἀθηνῶν ἀντιστῆσαι καὶ παραβαλεῖν τῷ πατρὶ τῆς ἀνικήτου καὶ μεγαλοδόξου Ῥώμης,

### Paragraph 3

εἴη μὲν οὖν ἡμῖν ἐκκαθαιρόμενον λόγῳ τὸ μυθῶδες ὑπακοῦσαι καὶ λαβεῖν ἱστορίας ὄψιν, ὅπου δ᾽ ἂν αὐθαδῶς τοῦ πιθανοῦ περιφρονῇ καὶ μὴ δέχηται τὴν πρὸς τὸ εἰκὸς μῖξιν, εὐγνωμόνων ἀκροατῶν δεησόμεθα καὶ πρᾴως τὴν ἀρχαιολογίαν προσδεχομένων.
