            "observations": "Exploration: Key challenge is simplifying abstracts for 7yo readability while keeping dignity—no cutesy terms like 'fairy tales' or 'magic stories'; stick to 'myths' or 'legendary parts' but test 'make-believe' vs 'old legends'. 'Purifying by reason': test 'clean with logic' (simple), 'wash myths with clear thinking' (vivid but not cartoonish), 'make myths reasonable' (direct). 'Submits and takes history's look': 'obeys and looks like history' vs 'follows reason and seems real'. Second clause: 'stubbornly scorns plausible/refuses probable mix' → 'won't believe what's likely/mix with possible' vs 'ignores believable parts'. 'Sensible hearers who gently receive ancient lore': 'kind smart listeners patient with old tales' vs 'nice understanding people okay with ancient stories'. Structure: Break into two sentences for flow, natural English order (hope first part succeeds; but where not, ask indulgence). Alternatives tested: 1. 'I hope logic cleans the myths so they seem true history. But if they won't blend with what's real, ask patient kids for old stories.' (too loose). 2. 'Use reason to purify fable into history's shape; where stubborn, beg kind readers for antiquity.' (too abstract). Best: Short sentences, basic words (hope, clean, look like, stubborn, believable, kind, patient, old stories), one para. Balances kid-simple with core meaning/imagery.",

            "issues": "Faithfulness: 'Clean' is loose for ἐκκαθαιρόμενον (purifying/refining), better as 'wash/purify myths'; 'mythical parts' fragments τὸ μυθῶδες (the mythical as entity); 'ignore what's believable' underplays αὐθαδῶς περιφρονῇ (stubbornly scorns/disdains credible); misses οὖν (therefore) and plural ἡμῖν/δεησόμεθα (our/we beg). Readability: 'Believable' and 'likely' slightly advanced for 7yo—risks minor confusion.
