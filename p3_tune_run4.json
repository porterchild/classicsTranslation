Alternatives: 'clean myths with reason so they obey and look like history'; 'purify fables by logic to resemble true events'; 'wash fanciful stories with smart thinking to seem factual'. Kid-friendly: short words like 'clean/obey/look like history'. Second clause: where it stubbornly (αὐθαδῶς) scorns plausible (περιφρονῇ τοῦ πιθανοῦ) and rejects mix with probable (μὴ δέχηται ... μῖξιν πρὸς τὸ εἰκὸς). Alternatives: 'stubbornly ignores believable things'; 'refuses to blend with what's likely'; merge to 'won't mix with probability'. Third: beg (δεησόμεθα) kind-minded hearers (εὐγνωμόνων ἀκροατῶν) who mildly receive ancient lore (πρᾴως ... ἀρχαιολογίαν). Alternatives: 'ask nice readers to gently take old stories'; 'need patient listeners for ancient tales'. Tested phrasings: 1. 'I hope reason cleans myths to obey/look historical, but if stubborn re: believable, need kind for old tales.' 2. 'Clean fables with logic so like history; where not believable, beg indulgent readers.' 3. 'Make myths reasonable like history; if they scorn likely mixes, ask gentle hearers for antiquity.' Chose #1 variant for natural kid flow: simple sentences, everyday words (clean, obey, stubborn, kind, old stories), merges synonyms (plausible/probable -> believable/likely), keeps dignity without slang/cutesy ('fairy' avoided, 'myths' retained as core, simple). One para, natural English structure.",

Settle on 'May reason clean up the myths so they obey and look like history' for fidelity + readability. Hard part 'αὐθαδῶς τοῦ πιθανοῦ περιφρονῇ καὶ μὴ δέχηται τὴν πρὸς τὸ εἰκὸς μῖξιν': tests—'stubbornly scorns believable and refuses mix with likely' (abstract); 'proudly ignores what sounds true and won't blend with what's possible' (smoother); 'won't accept what makes sense or mix in real possibilities' (merged pair into one idea per #12). Choose 'stubbornly says no to what sounds believable and refuses to blend with what's likely' → simplify to 'stubbornly rejects what makes sense and won't mix with what's possible' for 7yo naturalness. 'Akroaton' → 'readers' (modern over 'listeners'); 'archaiologian' → 'ancient tales' (kid-friendly vs 'old records,' preserves lore without vagueness). Structure: two sentences, short/active.
