## Final Translation

Just as in geographies, Sosius Senecio, historians cram the outermost edges of their maps with explanations for things beyond their knowledge—such as 'beyond lie waterless and savage sands,' 'unquenchable mud,' 'Scythian cold,' or 'frozen sea'—so too, in writing the Parallel Lives, after covering the accessible stretch of time with plausible reasoning and solid, fact-based history, it would be fitting to say of the earlier matters: 'Beyond that lie monstrous and tragic things, the domain of poets and mythographers, where credibility and clarity no longer hold.'

After publishing the discourse on Lycurgus the lawgiver and King Numa, it seemed reasonable to include Romulus as well, since our history had now reached times close to his. But as I pondered—in such a light, in the words of Aeschylus—'Who will turn up? Whom shall I set against him? Who is trustworthy?'—it appeared fitting to match the founder of beautiful and renowned Athens against the father of unconquered and greatly glorious Rome.

It would be well for us, then, to hear the mythical purified by reason and to gain a view of history; but wherever it arrogantly scorns the plausible and refuses to blend with the probable, we shall need understanding listeners who gently welcome the antiquarian inquiry.

## Paragraph 1

### Greek

ὥσπερ ἐν ταῖς γεωγραφίαις, ὦ Σόσσιε Σενεκίων, οἱ ἱστορικοὶ τὰ διαφεύγοντα τὴν γνῶσιν αὐτῶν τοῖς ἐσχάτοις μέρεσι τῶν πινάκων πιεζοῦντες, αἰτίας παραγράφουσιν ὅτι "τὰ δ᾽ ἐπέκεινα θῖνες ἄνυδροι καὶ θηριώδεις" ἢ "πηλὸς ἀϊδνὴς" ἢ "σκυθικὸν κρύος" ἢ "πέλαγος πεπηγός," οὕτως ἐμοὶ περὶ τὴν τῶν βίων τῶν παραλλήλων γραφήν, τὸν ἐφικτὸν εἰκότι λόγῳ καὶ βάσιμον ἱστορίᾳ πραγμάτων ἐχομένῃ χρόνον διελθόντι, περὶ τῶν ἀνωτέρω καλῶς εἶχεν εἰπεῖν· "τὰ δ᾽ ἐπέκεινα τερατώδη καὶ τραγικὰ ποιηταὶ καὶ μυθογράφοι νέμονται, καὶ οὐκέτ᾽ ἔχει πίστιν οὐδὲ σαφήνειαν."

### Final Synthesis

Just as in geographies, Sosius Senecio, historians cram the outermost edges of their maps with explanations for things beyond their knowledge—such as 'beyond lie waterless and savage sands,' 'unquenchable mud,' 'Scythian cold,' or 'frozen sea'—so too, in writing the Parallel Lives, after covering the accessible stretch of time with plausible reasoning and solid, fact-based history, it would be fitting to say of the earlier matters: 'Beyond that lie monstrous and tragic things, the domain of poets and mythographers, where credibility and clarity no longer hold.'

### Agent Final Versions

- `faithful`: Just as in geographies, O Sosius Senecio, historians cram into the outermost sections of their maps the things that escape their knowledge, appending reasons such as "beyond lie waterless and savage sands" or "unquenchable mud" or "Scythian cold" or "frozen sea," so too for me in writing the Parallel Lives—having traversed the accessible period with plausible reasoning and history substantial and holding to the facts—it would be fitting to say of the earlier matters: "beyond lie monstrous and tragic things over which poets and mythographers hold sway, and it no longer possesses credibility or clarity."
- `readable`: Just as in geographies, Sosius Senecio, historians cram the outermost edges of their maps with explanations for things beyond their knowledge—such as 'beyond lie waterless and savage sands,' 'unquenchable mud,' 'Scythian cold,' or 'frozen sea'—so too, in writing my Parallel Lives, after covering the accessible stretch of time with plausible reasoning and solid, fact-based history, it would be fitting to say of the earlier matters: 'Beyond that, monstrous and tragic subjects are the domain of poets and mythographers, where credibility and clarity no longer hold.'
- `modern`: Just as in geographies, Sosius Senecio, historians cram the outer edges of their maps with notes on the unknown—'parched, beast-haunted dunes,' 'unquenchable mud,' 'Scythian chill,' or 'frozen sea'—so too, writing these Parallel Lives, after mapping the accessible timeline with plausible reasoning and rock-solid history, it hit just right to say of earlier matters: 'Beyond that, poets and myth-spinners rule the monstrous and tragic—no credibility or clarity left.'

## Paragraph 2

### Greek

ἐπεὶ δὲ τὸν περὶ Λυκούργου τοῦ νομοθέτου καὶ Νομᾶ τοῦ βασιλέως λόγον ἐκδόντες, ἐδοκοῦμεν οὐκ ἂν ἀλόγως τῷ Ῥωμύλῳ προσαναβῆναι, πλησίον τῶν χρόνων αὐτοῦ τῇ ἱστορίᾳ γεγονότες, σκοποῦντι δέ μοι τοιῷδε φωτί (κατ᾽ Αἰσχύλον) τίς ξυμβήσεται; τίν᾽ ἀντιτάξω τῷδε; τίς φερέγγυος; ἐφαίνετο τὸν τῶν καλῶν καὶ ἀοιδίμων οἰκιστὴν Ἀθηνῶν ἀντιστῆσαι καὶ παραβαλεῖν τῷ πατρὶ τῆς ἀνικήτου καὶ μεγαλοδόξου Ῥώμης,

### Final Synthesis

After publishing the discourse on Lycurgus the lawgiver and King Numa, it seemed reasonable to include Romulus as well, since our history had now reached times close to his. But as I pondered—in such a light, in the words of Aeschylus—'Who will turn up? Whom shall I set against him? Who is trustworthy?'—it appeared fitting to match the founder of beautiful and renowned Athens against the father of unconquered and greatly glorious Rome.

### Agent Final Versions

- `faithful`: Since, after publishing the discourse concerning Lycurgus the lawgiver and Numa the king, we thought it not unreasonable to append to Romulus as well, the history having reached times close to his, but to me pondering in such a light (according to Aeschylus)—'Who will chance? Whom shall I set in opposition to this one? Who is reliable?'—it appeared to oppose and compare the founder of beautiful and renowned Athens to the father of unconquered and greatly glorious Rome.
- `readable`: After publishing the discourse on Lycurgus the lawgiver and King Numa, it seemed reasonable to add Romulus as well, since our history had now reached times close to his. But as I pondered—in such a light, in the words of Aeschylus—'Who will turn up? Whom shall I set against him? Who is trustworthy?'—it appeared fitting to match the founder of beautiful and illustrious Athens against the father of unconquered and greatly glorious Rome.
- `modern`: After dropping our discourse on Lycurgus the lawgiver and King Numa, it felt totally logical to roll right into Romulus—our history was basically brushing up against his era. But as I mulled it over in that Aeschylus spotlight glow—'Who'll step up? Who do I throw against this guy? Who's rock-solid?'—the obvious play was to pit Athens' stunning, legendarily sung founder against the father of unstoppable, mega-glorious Rome.

## Paragraph 3

### Greek

εἴη μὲν οὖν ἡμῖν ἐκκαθαιρόμενον λόγῳ τὸ μυθῶδες ὑπακοῦσαι καὶ λαβεῖν ἱστορίας ὄψιν, ὅπου δ᾽ ἂν αὐθαδῶς τοῦ πιθανοῦ περιφρονῇ καὶ μὴ δέχηται τὴν πρὸς τὸ εἰκὸς μῖξιν, εὐγνωμόνων ἀκροατῶν δεησόμεθα καὶ πρᾴως τὴν ἀρχαιολογίαν προσδεχομένων.

### Final Synthesis

It would be well for us, then, to hear the mythical purified by reason and to gain a view of history; but wherever it arrogantly scorns the plausible and refuses to blend with the probable, we shall need understanding listeners who gently welcome the antiquarian inquiry.

### Agent Final Versions

- `faithful`: It would be well for us, then, to hear the mythical purified by argument and to receive a sight of history; but wherever it arrogantly scorns the plausible and refuses the admixture with the probable, we shall need understanding hearers mildly receiving the antiquarian research.
- `readable`: It would be well for us, then, to hear the mythical element purified by reason and to gain a view of history; but wherever it arrogantly scorns the persuasive and refuses to blend with the probable, we shall need understanding listeners who gently welcome our antiquarian inquiry.
- `modern`: We’d love hearing the mythical stuff purified by logic and catching a glimpse of history. But wherever it arrogantly scorns the plausible and refuses to blend with the probable, we’ll need understanding listeners who chill with our old-school history dig.
