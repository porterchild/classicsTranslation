## Final Translation

Just as in geographies, Sosius Senecio, historians cram into the farthest edges of their maps the things escaping their knowledge, appending notes such as 'beyond lie waterless and beast-ridden dunes,' 'unquenchable mire,' 'Scythian cold,' or 'frozen sea'; so too for me, in writing the Parallel Lives, having traversed the accessible span of time with plausible reasoning and history grounded in facts, it would be fitting to say of the things above: 'beyond that, poets and mythographers range over monstrous and tragic matters, and it no longer has credibility nor clarity.'

Since, after publishing the discourse on Lycurgus the lawgiver and Numa the king, we thought it not unreasonable to take up Romulus as well—our history having come close to his times—but as I scanned with such a light (according to Aeschylus): 'Who will turn up? Whom shall I set against him? Who is reliable?' it seemed best to oppose and compare the founder of beautiful and much-sung Athens to the father of unconquered and greatly renowned Rome.

It would be well for us, then, to hear the mythical being purified by reason and catch a glimpse of history; but wherever it arrogantly scorns the plausible and refuses the mixture with the probable, we'll need discerning listeners who gently welcome the ancient inquiry.

## Paragraph 1

### Greek

ὥσπερ ἐν ταῖς γεωγραφίαις, ὦ Σόσσιε Σενεκίων, οἱ ἱστορικοὶ τὰ διαφεύγοντα τὴν γνῶσιν αὐτῶν τοῖς ἐσχάτοις μέρεσι τῶν πινάκων πιεζοῦντες, αἰτίας παραγράφουσιν ὅτι "τὰ δ᾽ ἐπέκεινα θῖνες ἄνυδροι καὶ θηριώδεις" ἢ "πηλὸς ἀϊδνὴς" ἢ "σκυθικὸν κρύος" ἢ "πέλαγος πεπηγός," οὕτως ἐμοὶ περὶ τὴν τῶν βίων τῶν παραλλήλων γραφήν, τὸν ἐφικτὸν εἰκότι λόγῳ καὶ βάσιμον ἱστορίᾳ πραγμάτων ἐχομένῃ χρόνον διελθόντι, περὶ τῶν ἀνωτέρω καλῶς εἶχεν εἰπεῖν· "τὰ δ᾽ ἐπέκεινα τερατώδη καὶ τραγικὰ ποιηταὶ καὶ μυθογράφοι νέμονται, καὶ οὐκέτ᾽ ἔχει πίστιν οὐδὲ σαφήνειαν."

### Final Synthesis

Just as in geographies, Sosius Senecio, historians cram into the farthest edges of their maps the things escaping their knowledge, appending notes such as 'beyond lie waterless and beast-ridden dunes,' 'unquenchable mire,' 'Scythian cold,' or 'frozen sea'; so too for me, in writing the Parallel Lives, having traversed the accessible span of time with plausible reasoning and history grounded in facts, it would be fitting to say of the things above: 'beyond that, poets and mythographers range over monstrous and tragic matters, and it no longer has credibility nor clarity.'

### Agent Final Versions

- `faithful`: Just as in geographical works, O Sosius Senecio, historians, squeezing into the farthest parts of their maps the things that escape their knowledge, append explanations such as 'beyond lie waterless and beast-ridden dunes' or 'inextinguishable mud' or 'Scythian cold' or 'frozen sea'; so too for me, in writing the Parallel Lives, having traversed the accessible time with plausible reasoning and history adhering to actual events, it would be fitting to say of the things above: 'beyond that, poets and mythographers range over monstrous and tragic matters, and it no longer has credibility nor clarity.'
- `readable`: Just as in geographies, Sosius Senecio, historians cram into the outermost edges of their maps the things escaping their knowledge, appending notes such as 'beyond lie waterless and beast-ridden dunes,' 'unquenchable mire,' 'Scythian cold,' or 'frozen sea'; so too for me, in writing the Parallel Lives, after traversing the accessible span of time with plausible reasoning and history grounded in facts, it would be fitting to say of more ancient times: 'beyond that, poets and mythographers range over monstrous and tragic matters that no longer have credibility or clarity.'
- `modern`: Just as in maps, Sosius Senecio, historians cram the edges of their charts with explanations for what escapes their knowledge—like 'beyond lie waterless, beast-haunted sands,' 'Stygian mire,' 'Scythian cold,' or 'frozen sea'—so too, crafting the Parallel Lives, after covering the accessible span of time with plausible reasoning and solid, fact-grounded history, it would suit me to say of earlier periods: 'Beyond that, poets and mythographers range over the monstrous and tragic, and there's no more credibility or clarity.'

## Paragraph 2

### Greek

ἐπεὶ δὲ τὸν περὶ Λυκούργου τοῦ νομοθέτου καὶ Νομᾶ τοῦ βασιλέως λόγον ἐκδόντες, ἐδοκοῦμεν οὐκ ἂν ἀλόγως τῷ Ῥωμύλῳ προσαναβῆναι, πλησίον τῶν χρόνων αὐτοῦ τῇ ἱστορίᾳ γεγονότες, σκοποῦντι δέ μοι τοιῷδε φωτί (κατ᾽ Αἰσχύλον) τίς ξυμβήσεται; τίν᾽ ἀντιτάξω τῷδε; τίς φερέγγυος; ἐφαίνετο τὸν τῶν καλῶν καὶ ἀοιδίμων οἰκιστὴν Ἀθηνῶν ἀντιστῆσαι καὶ παραβαλεῖν τῷ πατρὶ τῆς ἀνικήτου καὶ μεγαλοδόξου Ῥώμης,

### Final Synthesis

Since, after publishing the discourse on Lycurgus the lawgiver and Numa the king, we thought it not unreasonable to take up Romulus as well—our history having come close to his times—but as I scanned with such a light (according to Aeschylus): 'Who will turn up? Whom shall I set against him? Who is reliable?' it seemed best to oppose and compare the founder of beautiful and much-sung Athens to the father of unconquered and greatly renowned Rome.

### Agent Final Versions

- `faithful`: Since, having published the discourse on Lycurgus the lawgiver and Numa the king, we thought it would not be unreasonable to take up Romulus as well, having come close to his times in our history, but to me, as I scan with such a light (according to Aeschylus), who will meet? Whom shall I set in opposition to this one? Who is reliable? It seemed best to set in opposition and compare the founder of beautiful and renowned-in-song Athens to the father of unconquered and of great renown Rome.
- `readable`: After publishing the discourse on Lycurgus the lawgiver and Numa the king, we thought it not unreasonable to add Romulus too—our history having come close to his times. But as I scanned with such a light (according to Aeschylus): 'Who will turn up? Whom shall I set against him? Who is reliable?' it seemed best to oppose and compare the founder of beautiful and much-sung Athens to the father of unconquered and greatly renowned Rome.
- `modern`: We'd just published our pieces on Lycurgus the lawgiver and King Numa, so Romulus felt like a natural next step—our history edging right into his time frame. But as I scanned with this kinda light (Aeschylus-style): who's gonna turn up? Who to throw at this guy? Who's reliable? It seemed like the smart move to pit the founder of beautiful, legendary Athens against the father of unbeatable, mega-renowned Rome.

## Paragraph 3

### Greek

εἴη μὲν οὖν ἡμῖν ἐκκαθαιρόμενον λόγῳ τὸ μυθῶδες ὑπακοῦσαι καὶ λαβεῖν ἱστορίας ὄψιν, ὅπου δ᾽ ἂν αὐθαδῶς τοῦ πιθανοῦ περιφρονῇ καὶ μὴ δέχηται τὴν πρὸς τὸ εἰκὸς μῖξιν, εὐγνωμόνων ἀκροατῶν δεησόμεθα καὶ πρᾴως τὴν ἀρχαιολογίαν προσδεχομένων.

### Final Synthesis

It would be well for us, then, to hear the mythical being purified by reason and catch a glimpse of history; but wherever it arrogantly scorns the plausible and refuses the mixture with the probable, we'll need discerning listeners who gently welcome the ancient inquiry.

### Agent Final Versions

- `faithful`: It would be well for us, then, to hear the mythical being purified by reason and to receive a sight of history; but wherever the mythical arrogantly scorns the plausible and refuses the mixture with the probable, we shall need discerning hearers who gently welcome the ancient inquiry.
- `readable`: It would be well for us, then, to hear the mythical being purified by reason and catch a view of history; but wherever it arrogantly scorns the plausible and refuses to blend with the probable, we'll need understanding listeners who gently welcome the ancient inquiry.
- `modern`: It'd be awesome for us, then, to hear the myths purified by reason and catch a glimpse of history; but wherever it arrogantly scorns the plausible and refuses to mix with the probable, we'll need savvy listeners who gently welcome the ancient inquiry.
