For 7yo readability: short sentences, simple words like 'myths' (not fairy tales), 'reason/thinking', 'believable/possible', 'history/true stories', 'old tales'; avoid complex clauses by recasting into if-then flow. Tested phrasings: 'I hope to clean myths with thinking so they follow and look like history, but if they won't mix believable parts, need patient listeners.' vs 'May myths obey reason and seem historical where possible, else beg kind readers for old stories.' vs 'Use reason to purify myths into history-look; where stubborn, ask nice folks to be gentle with ancient bits.'

End: 'beg kind readers who gently accept ancient stories'—tested 'nice listeners patiently welcoming old tales' (cutesy); 'ask understanding hearers to mildly receive antiquity's records' (stiff); refs favor 'readers/indulgent' so switched from listeners, 'gently accept ancient stories' softens πρᾴως/προσδεχομένων naturally.
