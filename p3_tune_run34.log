But if a myth won't mix with what's believable, I'll need kind listeners who patiently accept old stories. b) Source-close sketch: May it be for us, purifying the mythical with speech, to obey and take history's appearance, but wherever it arrogantly scorns the plausible and refuses the mix toward the likely, we shall need good-minded hearers and those mildly receiving the ancient inquiry. c) Candidates: 1. 'I want to wash away the fairy-tale parts with reason to make it seem like history. Where it stubbornly ignores what's likely and won't blend in, I'll ask smart, patient listeners for old tales.' 2.

[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 1] [sequential] judgment: Strong first iteration: captures core wish-contrast structure faithfully in plain modern English, flows smoothly for young readers, but minor abstraction leaks and pronoun shifts reduce kid-level clarity.[0m
[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 1] [sequential] strengths: Smooth two-sentence flow with clear 'hope... but' contrast mirrors source; everyday verbs like 'clean up', 'ignores', 'blend' avoid Greek-shaped syntax; direct outcome phrasing ('look like real history') rewards intent over stiff figuration; merges 'obey and take appearance' into natural 'so they look like' without dropping relations.[0m
[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 1] [sequential] issues: 'Likelihood' too abstract for 7yo (penalize abstraction stacks); personifies 'a myth' as stubborn actor, risking confusion vs source's neuter element; shifts source 'us/we' (ἡμῖν/δεησόμεθα) to singular 'I/I'll need', losing collective tone; 'clear thinking' indirect for λόγῳ vs plainer 'reason'; 'stubbornly ignores what's believable' stacks adverbs/abstracts when 'won't mix with what makes sense' would clarify.[0m

[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 2] [sequential] judgment: Strong readability and modernity for a 7-year-old audience, with smooth plain flow, but faithfulness dips slightly from rephrasing the wish as active 'we use reason' instead of passive purification of myths, and omitting the myths' 'obeying' reason.[0m
[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 2] [sequential] strengths: Uses everyday terms like 'make-believe bits' for myths and 'what makes sense' for plausible/probable, fitting 7yo level; splits into two smooth clauses with clear contrast via 'but wherever'; modern casual tone like a storybook without slang or archaisms; preserves core wish-contrast-begging structure without dropping relations.[0m
[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 2] [sequential] issues: Shifts source's passive optative wish ('may it be purified by reason, obey, and take history's look') to active 'may we use reason to clean,' losing the myths' submission; vague 'true history' for 'history's appearance/semblance'; 'patiently welcome ancient tales' softens 'gently receive ancient inquiry' but risks underplaying 'sensible' listeners; minor pronoun clarity as 'they' works but could tie tighter to myths.[0m

Second: 'But where they stubbornly ignore what seems likely and refuse to blend with it, we'll ask for kind listeners who gently accept old stories.'

[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 3] [sequential] judgment: Strong iteration: highly readable and modern with excellent flow for a 7-year-old audience, faithful to core intent and contrast without dropping relations, but minor word choices like 'scorn' and 'stubbornly' slightly elevate vocabulary above plain everyday level, and first clause subtly shifts agency from myths obeying to reason cleaning.[0m
[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 3] [sequential] strengths: Smooth plain clauses with natural flow; everyday terms like 'make-believe parts' and 'look of real history' concretely express abstracts; preserves wish-contrast structure and key relations (purify/obey/history-look vs stubborn refusal/blend/kind welcome); merged phrasing improves readability without loss.[0m
[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 3] [sequential] issues: 'Scorn' and 'stubbornly' feel mildly bookish for 7yo (penalize vocab above target); 'make-believe parts' good but pluralizes singular 'mythodes'; 'what seems likely' indirect for 'pithanon/eikos' (penalize indirect abstract relations); 'blend with it' clear but pronoun 'it' slightly vague without repeat; no core drops but first clause personifies 'reason' actively vs source's passive myth-purifying.[0m

This uses 'fairy-tale stuff' for mythos (plainer 7yo term), 'clear thinking' for logos, 'proudly ignores' for authados periphronei (drops 'scorn/stubbornly'), 'what makes sense/real possibilities' direct for pithanon/eikos/mixis, 'looks like true history' tightens opsin, 'with patience' plainer for praiōs/eugnomōn.[0m

[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 4] [sequential] issues: 'Fairy-tale stuff' cutesy for μυθῶδες, better as plain 'myths'; 'boldly skips what makes sense' slangy/calque-skirting for αὐθαδῶς τοῦ πιθανοῦ περιφρονῇ, dilutes arrogant disdain; 'make it obey' forces personification stiffly where direct outcome like 'fit reason' works; 'I hope we can' personalizes impersonal optative εἴη ἡμῖν, losing prayer tone; 'listeners' OK but 'old stories' flattens ἀρχαιολογίαν's ancient inquiry nuance.[0m
