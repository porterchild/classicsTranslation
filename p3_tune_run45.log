[93m[paragraph 1] user preference prompt: Write as a short modern kids' nonfiction paragraph for age 7. Keep the main logic and contrast from the Greek, but prefer one clear plain phrasing per idea. Avoid formal translation wording and avoid cutesy substitute nouns. Recast awkward structure freely.[0m
[93m[paragraph 1] reference input [dryden_clough]: May I therefore succeed in purifying fable, making it submit to reason so as to assume the face of history.

[96m[paragraph 1] [iter 1] [sequential] observations: a) Plain restatement for kids: I hope to clean up myths with reason so they look like true history, but if myths stubbornly won't mix with what's believable, I'll ask for kind readers to gently accept ancient tales. b) Source-close sketch: May it be ours for the mythical, purified by reason, to obey and take history's appearance; but wherever it arrogantly scorns the plausible and refuses mix with the probable, we shall beg understanding hearers who mildly receive the ancient records. c) Candidates: 1. Reason will scrub myths clean to seem historical; stubborn ones need patient kids for old stories. 2. Let's make myths logical like history—but beg kindness for the unbelievable ancient bits (breaks syntax). Focus: simplify contrast, one phrasing per idea, kid-plain dignified.[0m

[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 1] [sequential] judgment: Strong adaptation for 7-year-olds: captures core hope-contrast logic plainly without dropping relations, flows naturally, and uses kid-level modern English; minor tweaks needed for maximally direct outcome phrasing.[0m
[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 1] [sequential] strengths: Preserves exact contrast (rationalized myths as history vs. indulgent readers for stubborn parts); one clear phrasing per idea with merged flow; simple sentences and words like 'clean up' and 'stubbornly refuse' suit kids' nonfiction without cutesy slang; no abstract chains or translationese.[0m
[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 1] [sequential] issues: 'Blend with what's likely' slightly indirect and vague for age 7 (better as direct 'mix in real possibilities'); 'seem believable' repeats idea of 'look like true history' indirectly; 'patiently accept' borrows indulgent tone from refs instead of fresh plain 'forgive old tales' phrasing.[0m
[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 1] [sequential] revision plan: Change to: 'I hope to use reason to clean up myths and make them look like real history. But if some myths stubbornly won't mix with real possibilities or sound true, I'll need kind readers who forgive these old stories.' This uses direct outcome verbs ('mix... sound true'), swaps 'patiently accept' for plain 'forgive', keeps length short.[0m
