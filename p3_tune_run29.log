But if a tale stays silly and won't mix in anything believable, I need kind listeners who patiently accept old stories. b) Source-close sketch: May it be for us the mythical, purified by reason, obeys and takes history's face; but wherever it arrogantly scorns the plausible and rejects mixture toward the likely, we shall beg clear-minded hearers who gently receive the ancient lore. c) Candidates: 1. I hope reason cleans myths to look like history, but where they won't blend with what's likely, need patient readers (breaks syntax by dropping conditionals). 2. May myths submit to reason and wear history's mask, yet if stubborn against probability, seek indulgent ancient-story fans. 3. Clean fairy tales with brainpower for history look; stubborn ones need nice, easygoing listeners.[0m

[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 1] [sequential] judgment: Strong first iteration: faithful and readable with modern flow, but some abstract terms like 'believable' and 'likely' push beyond 7yo level; needs plainer swaps for everyday concretes without dropping contrasts.[0m
[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 1] [sequential] strengths: Smooth two-sentence structure mirrors source contrast; 'clean up the myths so they obey and look like true history' directly conveys purification and visual likeness intent; 'stubbornly reject... refuse to mix in' preserves willful refusal dynamic; merged 'kind listeners who patiently welcome' flows naturally while hitting εὐγνωμόνων and πρᾴως.[0m
[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 1] [sequential] issues: 'Clear thinking' abstracts λόγῳ (reason/account) into vague phrase when 'reason' is plainer; 'anything believable' and 'what's likely' stack mild abstractions (πιθανόν/εἰκὸς as plausible/probable) unsuitable for 7yo—need concrete like 'makes sense'; 'true history' adds unsubtle emphasis not in source's neutral 'history's face'; minor personification of myths as 'they' works but risks pronoun confusion for kids.[0m
