[96m[paragraph 1] [iter 1] [sequential] observations: Simple restate: Author hopes to use reason to purify/clean myths so they obey and resemble history; but where myths stubbornly reject believability/probability mixing, appeals to kind/patient listeners for ancient tales. Hard parts: ἐκκαθαιρόμενον λόγῳ τὸ μυθῶδες - options: 'clean myths with reason', 'make myths reasonable with thinking', 'purify fanciful parts by logic' (chose 'clean up myths with reason' for concrete flow); ὑπακοῦσαι καὶ λαβεῖν ἱστορίας ὄψιν - 'obey and look like history' vs 'submit and take history's face' vs 'follow and seem real history'; αὐθαδῶς...μῖξιν - merge πιθανόν/εἰκός into 'believable'/'makes sense' to avoid stacked abstracts (options: 'stubbornly scorns credible + refuses probable mix' -> 'stubbornly refuse to mix with what's believable'); εὐγνωμόνων...προσδεχομένων - 'kind indulgent hearers for ancient lore' vs 'nice patient listeners to old stories'. Explored phrasings: 1. 'I hope reason cleans myths to look like history, but if not believable, need patient readers.' 2. 'Wish to fix myths with thinking so they match real events; else ask kind folks for old tales patience.' 3. 'May myths obey reason and seem historical; where stubborn, beg understanding for antiquity.' Chose clearest natural: short sentences, concrete 'clean up...look like...refuse to mix...kind listeners...old stories'; drop personification; one para preserves wish-conditional structure.[0m

[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 1] [sequential] judgment: Strong readability for a 7-year-old audience with modern flow, but faithfulness dips due to personalizing the optative wish as 'I hope' and loose renderings of key terms like purification and antiquities; personification of myths works but borders on translationese.[0m
[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 1] [sequential] strengths: Excellent short sentences and simple vocabulary flow naturally like modern kids' prose; preserves core contrast between purification and indulgence without dropping relations; 'stubbornly refuse' captures αὐθαδῶς well; no convoluted structures or archaic feel.[0m
[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 1] [sequential] issues: 'I hope to clean up' shifts impersonal optative (εἴη...ἡμῖν ἐκκαθαιρόμενον) to personal action, unlike references' 'May I succeed'; 'clean up' too casual/domestic for ἐκκαθαιρόμενον (purifying/cleansing); 'old stories' oversimplifies ἀρχαιολογίαν (ancient records/lore) vs. refs' 'antiquity in its records/tales'; 'mix with what's believable' abstract chain feels slightly analytical (τοῦ πιθανοῦ...πρὸς τὸ εἰκὸς); myths as 'they' personifies like sources but reads source-shaped for kids—natural enough but flag for potential clunk.[0m
[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 1] [sequential] revision plan: Restore optative wish as 'May we...' or 'I wish we could...' for faithfulness without losing simplicity; change 'clean up' to 'purify' or 'wash clean' if kid-friendly; 'mix with what's believable' to 'blend with things that could be true'; 'old stories' to 'ancient tales' or 'old-time records'; test 'make myths obey reason and look like history' to merge ὑπακοῦσαι/λαβεῖν naturally; keep 'kind listeners who patiently welcome' but tweak 'patiently' to 'gently' for πρᾴως.[0m

[96m[paragraph 1] [iter 2] [sequential] observations: Simple plain restatement: I want to purify myths using reason so they obey and look like history, but if they won't mix with believable stuff, I need kind people who gently accept old tales. Source-close: May it be ours, the mythical being purified by reason, to make it obey and take history's appearance; but wherever it arrogantly scorns plausibility and refuses mixture toward the likely, we shall beg sensible hearers who mildly receive antiquities. Interpolation: Blend wish as 'May we...' (restores optative faithfulness per prior, kid-simple like 'May we play?'); ἐκκαθαιρόμενον as 'purify/cleans out' → test 'purify myths with reason' (dignified, not casual 'clean up'), alt 'wash myths clean with logic' (concrete but vivid), 'clear myths of nonsense with reason' (kid-event style); ὑπακοῦσαι καὶ λαβεῖν → 'obey and look like' (natural merge, prior strength); αὐθαδῶς...μῖξιν → 'stubbornly refuse to blend with what's likely/believable' (one phrase vs stacked abstracts, test 'won't mix in true possibilities' or 'ignores real chances and skips blending truth'; prior 'mix with what's believable' good but tweak to 'blend with true things'); ἀρχαιολογίαν → 'ancient tales/accounts' (keeps 'ancient' vs prior 'old stories', refs 'tales of antiquity/records'; alt 'old-time history bits'); structure: Two sentences for flow, keep contrast; personification natural-ish for kids (myths 'refuse'), no calque; fixes prior: optative 'May we succeed in purifying...', purify over clean up, ancient tales, blend with likely. Explored: 'May our words purify myths so they follow reason and seem historical...' (too vague); 'I wish to scrub fable clean...' (personal/cutesy no); 'May reason cleanse myths to obey and wear history's face...' (imagery but abstract); best: clear clauses, event-like 'making them obey and look like'. Chosen for 7yo: short words (stubbornly→boldly? no, keep vivid), one-idea chunks.[0m

[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 2] [sequential] judgment: Strong on readability and modernity for a 7-year-old audience, with natural flow and simple prose. Faithfulness is solid but slightly loose in restructuring the optative wish into active 'we purify' and casual 'we'll need', softening the source's humble plea.[0m
[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 2] [sequential] strengths: Excellent short sentences and everyday words like 'look like', 'stubbornly scorn', 'blend', 'kind listeners' make it flow naturally like a modern storybook. Preserves core contrast between purification and indulgence without dropping relations. No translationese, calques, or awkward abstractions; merged phrasing improves clarity.[0m
[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 2] [sequential] issues: Slight faithfulness drift: source optative 'eiē... hemin' is a wish for success ('may it be ours that the mythical, purified by reason, obeys...'), not direct 'May we purify'. 'Obey' feels a tad stiff/personified for myths as agents (source neuter subject). 'Listeners' mirrors 'akroaton' literally but less natural than 'readers' for written context (per references). 'We'll need' casualizes source's deferential 'deesometha' (beg/pray for). No cutesy/babyish tone, but 'gently welcome' borders soft for 'praios prosdekhomenon'.[0m
[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 2] [sequential] revision plan: Shift to 'I hope we can clean myths with reason, so they listen and seem like real history.' For second sentence: 'But where they won't mix with believable or likely things, I hope for kind readers who nicely accept old stories.' Replace 'obey' with 'listen' for softer personification; 'we'll need' to 'I hope for' to capture plea; 'listeners' to 'readers'; 'ancient tales' to 'old stories' for 7yo simplicity. Ensure myths as 'they' but tone down agency if clunky.[0m

[96m[paragraph 1] [iter 3] [sequential] observations: Plain restate: Speaker hopes reason purifies myths so they obey and resemble history; but where myths arrogantly reject believability and won't blend with probability, begs for indulgent readers who kindly accept ancient lore. Source-close: 'May it be ours: mythical, reason-purified, obeys & takes history's face; but wherever it haughtily scorns believable & rejects mix w/ likely, we'll beg understanding hearers who mildly receive antiquities.' Interpolation for 7yo: Start simple 'I hope reason cleans myths so they listen & look like true stories' vs closer 'May we succeed in reason-washing myths to obey & wear history's look'; test options: 1st clause - 'I hope we clean myths w/ reason so they follow & seem historical' (natural, drops stiff 'obey'); alt 'Wish myths get purified by logic, obey reason, look like facts'; 'Use words to scrub fairy tales clean till they act right & match history' (too cartoonish, avoid). 2nd: 'But if they bossily skip believable stuff & won't join likely things, ask kind readers to nicely take old tales' vs 'Where myths snub credible & shun probable mix, pray for patient audience welcoming ancients gently'; test 'stubbornly ignore believable & refuse likely blend' (concrete); 'won't mix w/ what's possible' (merges πιθανόν/εἰκός naturally, avoids stack); plea as 'I hope for kind readers who welcome old stories with patience' (humble, fixes casual 'we'll need'); 'readers' over 'listeners' for context; 'ancient stories/old tales' simple/dignified. Final: 'I hope we can purify myths with reason so they obey and look like history. But wherever they stubbornly scorn what's believable and refuse to blend with what's likely, we'll beg kind readers to gently welcome ancient records.' Tweaks prior: 'purify' dignified over 'clean'; 'obey' kept lightly personified as natural; 'beg' captures δεησόμεθα plea; one para, short sentences, no cutesy/slANG.[0m

[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 3] [sequential] judgment: Strong iteration: faithful simplification with excellent kid-level readability and modern naturalness, but minor personification and word choices slightly elevate beyond pure 7yo accessibility.[0m
[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 3] [sequential] strengths: Preserves core wish-contrast structure without dropping relations; merges 'submit and take on face of history' into fluid 'obey and look like history'; 'blend with what's likely' naturally conveys mixture; conversational 'I hope we can' and 'we'll beg' feels like modern storytelling; short sentences flow effortlessly for young readers.[0m
[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 3] [sequential] issues: 'They stubbornly scorn what's believable' personifies myths unnaturally for 7yo (myths as willful agents feels source-shaped, not everyday English); 'scorn' and 'believable/likely' are abstract pairs reading like translationese (slight calque of πιθανόν/εἰκός distinction without kid-natural synonyms); 'purify myths with reason' good but 'obey' implies direct command over subtle submission; 'gently welcome ancient tales' softens πρᾴως προσδεχομένων well but 'ancient tales' risks mild archaic vibe vs. 'old stories'.[0m
[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 3] [sequential] revision plan: Depersonify to 'where myths won't mix with believable parts'; swap 'scorn what's believable/refuse to blend with what's likely' to 'ignore what seems real and won't mix in anything probable' or 'stubbornly skip believable stuff and reject mixing with likely ideas'; simplify 'purify... so they obey and look like' to 'clean myths using reason, making them follow it and seem like real history'; tweak 'kind readers who gently welcome' to 'nice listeners who kindly accept old stories'; ensure zero abstract chains by testing aloud for 7yo comprehension.[0m

[96m[paragraph 1] [iter 4] [sequential] observations: Simple restatement: Writer hopes to use reason to clean myths so they seem like true history; but if myths can't be made believable or mixed with likely ideas, needs patient listeners for old stories. Source-close: May we succeed in purifying myth via reason, making it obey & take history's appearance; but wherever it arrogantly scorns believable & refuses mix w/ likely, we'll beg understanding hearers who mildly receive antiquities. Prior fixes: Depersonify myths (no 'stubbornly scorn'); merge πιθανόν/εἰκός into one smooth kid-phrase like 'believable/likely stuff' → 'what seems real and possible'; simplify purify/obey/face → 'clean w/ reason so they follow & look like history'; readers → 'nice listeners who kindly accept old stories'. Explore hard parts: Purify/submit/face: 'clean myths w/ reason so they follow it & seem like history' (natural); alt 'wash fanciful parts away w/ logic to make myths look real' (too loose); 'use thinking to tidy myths into true-story shape' (kid-ok but drops obey). Arrogant scorn/refuse mix: Depersonify to 'where myths won't blend believable/real parts' or 'if myths can't mix w/ what seems true & possible'; test 'won't fit w/ real-seeming ideas or likely things' (flows); alt 'ignores what's believable & skips mixing real bits' (concrete events); 'stubbornly stays fanciful w/o probable touches' (avoids personif, one phrase). Readers: 'nice listeners who kindly take old stories' vs 'patient kids who welcome ancient tales gently' (dignified, no cutesy); test aloud: 'We'll need kind friends reading who softly hug old tales' (too cartoony, reject). Interpolation: Blend plain 'hope clean myths to look real, but if not, need nice readers for olds' w/ source for 'I hope reason cleans myths to follow/look like history, but where no believable mix, beg kind gentle receivers of old lore' → choose 'I hope we can clean myths with reason so they follow it and look like history. But where they won't mix with what's believable or likely, we'll ask nice listeners who kindly accept old stories.' (natural clauses, one-pass kid-flow, keeps wish/contrast/beg structure, merges abstracts concretely w/o delete). Final pick clearest: Zero stacks, event-style 'won't mix', modern storytell tone.[0m
