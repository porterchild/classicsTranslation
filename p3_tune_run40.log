[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 1] [sequential] judgment: Solid first pass with strong simplicity and flow for young readers, but faithfulness dips from rephrasing the optative wish as personal agency and softening the personification of myth; readability shines but could trim minor abstractions.[0m
[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 1] [sequential] strengths: Uses everyday words like 'clean up,' 'stubbornly ignores,' 'blend in' to make abstracts concrete; smooth two-sentence structure with clear contrast; natural modern tone like a kids' story explanation.[0m
[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 1] [sequential] issues: First clause shifts source's impersonal optative process ('may the mythical be purified by reason, submit, and take history's look') to active 'I hope I can clean up the myths,' losing the myth-as-agent dynamic; 'clear thinking' abstracts λόγῳ better as plain 'reason'; 'what makes sense' and 'believable' double up on πιθανοῦ/εἰκὸς without crisp merge; 'old stories' flattens ἀρχαιολογίαν's sense of ancient records/lore.[0m

[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 2] [sequential] judgment: Very strong for 7yo readability with smooth plain flow and core contrast intact, but minor faithfulness dips from over-personifying myths as active rejectors and synonymizing distinct Greek terms πιθανόν/εἰκός; excellent modernity.[0m
[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 2] [sequential] strengths: Smooth two-sentence structure mirrors source contrast perfectly without convolution; everyday verbs like 'clean up', 'reject', 'mix in' make abstracts concrete and 7yo-friendly; 'I hope' naturally conveys optative wish; 'kind listeners who patiently welcome' plainly dignifies εὐγνωμόνων/πρᾴως without bookish tone.[0m
[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 2] [sequential] issues: Personifies 'myths' as stubborn agents rejecting/mixing, shifting from source's neuter τὸ μυθῶδες as passive object obeying reason; treats πιθανόν (persuasive/credible) and εἰκὸς (probable/likely) as near-synonyms 'believable/likely' instead of distinct scorn vs. mixture; 'clear thinking' slightly abstract chain vs. plain 'reason'; 'real history' adds 'real' not in source's mere 'appearance'; 'listeners' narrows ἀκροατῶν (hearers broadly).[0m
