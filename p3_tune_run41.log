Clean stories with smart talk to look real? Good. Stubborn silly ones? Need nice patient kids for ancient bits. (breaks syntax for flow). 3. Hope to make myths reasonable like history; if not, ask gentle hearers to accept old tales softly.[0m

[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 1] [sequential] judgment: Solid simplification that's highly readable for a 7-year-old with smooth flow and plain language, but minor fidelity slips in key terms like 'clear thinking' and 'old stories' dilute precise contrasts from the source.[0m
[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 1] [sequential] strengths: Breaks complex optative wish into natural 'I hope' clause; uses everyday actions like 'clean up' and 'blend' for abstract purification/mixture; short plain sentences flow like spoken story; captures core contrast without dropping relations.[0m
[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 1] [sequential] issues: 'Clear thinking' too vague and modernized for 'λόγῳ' (reason/argument), losing intellectual edge; 'listeners' evokes ancient oratory over modern 'readers'; 'old stories' flattens 'ἀρχαιολογίαν' (ancient inquiry/records) into generic tales, missing dignified research tone; mild personification of 'myth' as agent is okay but risks cutesiness vs source's abstract 'mythical element'.[0m
[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 1] [sequential] revision plan: Change 'clean up the myths with clear thinking' to 'purify myths using reason'; swap 'listeners' to 'readers'; upgrade 'old stories' to 'ancient records'; tweak second sentence to 'But if it stubbornly scorns what's believable and won't mix with what's likely' for tighter source match; ensure no added 'real' to 'history'—use 'look like history' directly.[0m
