Source-close sketch: May it be ours the mythical purified by reason submitting and taking history's face, but wherever arrogantly it scorns plausible and refuses mix with likely, we shall beg good-minded hearers gently receiving ancient lore. Interpolation tests: 'Clean myths with logic so they obey and seem historical' (keeps personification mildly); alt: 'Use reason to make myths believable like history' (drops personif.); bolder paraphrase breaking syntax: 'Let logic turn story myths into true history. When myths stay stubborn and unbelievable, need nice folks okay with old tales.' Hard parts: μυθῶδες='myths/old made-up stories'; ἐκκαθαιρόμενον λόγῳ='clean with reason/logic'; αὐθαδῶς...μῖξιν='stubbornly refuse believable mix' -> 'won't blend with what's likely/realistic'; ἀρχαιολογίαν='old tales/stories'. Options: 'Myths obey reason' vs 'stories get cleaned by thinking'; prefer 'use clear thinking to fix myths'. Personif natural as 'if myths won't mix'; everyday verbs 'fix/clean/blend'. Final picks shortest natural flow: short sentences, concrete 'look like real history', explicit refs, no abstracts stacked. Self-checked: restatement conversational, not source-like.[0m

[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 1] [sequential] judgment: Strong first iteration: highly readable and modern for a 7-year-old audience with short sentences and simple words, while closely preserving the core wish-contrast structure and meaning. Minor faithfulness tweaks needed for optative tone and precise terms, but no major losses.[0m
[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 1] [sequential] strengths: Excellent short, clear sentences that flow naturally; simple vocabulary like 'clean up,' 'stubbornly ignore,' 'kind readers' perfect for 7yo; preserves key contrast between purification success and indulgent request; natural modern phrasing feels like a storybook explanation, not translationese.[0m
[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 1] [sequential] issues: Optative wish ('may it be for us') softened to casual 'I hope,' slightly diluting formal aspirational tone—feels more personal than source's plural 'us'; personification of myths as 'they' (obey/ignore/refuse) mirrors Greek neuter subject but borders on stiff for kid prose, better depersonified as process; 'real history' adds interpretive 'real' not in source's neutral 'history's appearance'; 'old stories' simplifies 'ἀρχαιολογίαν' (ancient lore/records) well but could nod to 'ancient tales' for tone without complexity; 'mix in anything likely' good but 'likely' repeats 'believable' vibe redundantly.[0m
[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 1] [sequential] revision plan: Shift 'I hope' to 'May I use reason to clean the myths so they submit and look like history' for optative feel in simple terms; depersonify second clause to 'But where myths stubbornly reject what's believable and won't blend with what's likely...'; tweak 'old stories' to 'ancient tales' if kid-friendly; ensure no pronoun chains by specifying 'reason' once more if needed; test full read-aloud for 7yo smoothness.[0m

[96m[paragraph 1] [iter 2] [sequential] observations: Plain restatement (natural convo for 7yo): I want to use clear thinking to fix up the myths so they sound like true history. If some myths won't mix with stuff that makes sense, I need kind listeners who are nice about the old tales. Source-close sketch: May it be for us, argument purifying the mythical, to hear and take history's appearance, but wherever arrogantly scorning the plausible and not receiving mixture to the likely, needing clear-minded hearers gently receiving the antiquities. Interpolation tests: (1) Personified mild: 'May reason clean myths so they obey and look like history. But if myths stubbornly ignore believable stuff and refuse likely blends, ask kind readers to gently take ancient tales.' Flows ok but 'they' pronouns chain slightly stiff for kids. (2) Depersonified condition: 'May we purify myths with reason to make them seem historical. But where myths can't blend believably with likelihood, need patient listeners welcoming old stories kindly.' Smoother, breaks syntax for natural if/where clause. (3) Bolder paraphrase breaking syntax: 'Let clear thinking scrub myths clean to match history. When myths stay too wild for belief, hope readers forgive ancient legends nicely.' More story-like but risks loose on 'perifronēi' arrogance/pride. (4) Optative kid-tune: 'Please let reason tidy the myths so they fit history's look. If they won't play fair with what's possible, I'll beg nice folks to accept old-time tales.' Too pleading/cutesy, drop. Best interp: Depersonify to process, optative 'May we...' for 'hēmin' plural wish, 'ancient tales' for ἀρχαιολογίαν tone without complexity, 'clean up' over 'purify' for everyday verb, 'believable'/'likely' merged to one clear 'makes sense' idea if needed but keep contrast lightly; prior fixes: optative over 'hope', drop 'real', 'gently accept ancient tales'. Full read-aloud smooth for 7yo: short sentences, concrete actions (clean/blend/accept), no abstracts stacked. Self-check plain restatement: Feels like storyteller chatting, not translation—good.[0m

[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 2] [sequential] judgment: Strong iteration: highly readable and modern for a 7-year-old audience with short sentences and simple phrasing. Faithfulness is solid on core meaning and contrasts but loosens the source's optative wish structure and passive process into active 'we use,' slightly shifting agency. Natural English flow avoids most translationese.[0m
[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 2] [sequential] strengths: Excellent short, clear sentences that flow naturally like modern kids' storytelling. Simple words like 'clean up,' 'stubbornly reject,' 'kind listeners' fit 7yo level without cutesy or babyish tone. Preserves key contrast (purify vs. stubborn refusal) and hopeful tone. Depersonifies slightly for readability without dropping relations. 'Gently welcome ancient tales' captures indulgence naturally.[0m
[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 2] [sequential] issues: Opening shifts source's passive optative ('may it be for us that mythical, purified by reason, submits') to active 'May we use reason to clean up'—alters agency from process on myths to our action, less faithful. Personification of myths as 'they' mirrors source but feels mildly source-shaped; could depersonify more for kid-natural prose. 'What's believable/likely' is clear but abstract—'likely' slightly above 7yo baseline when 'possible/real' simpler. 'Ancient tales' loose for ἀρχαιολογίαν (antiquities/records); refs use 'records/tales of antiquity'—risks softening investigative tone. Minor pronoun 'it' (reason) clear but chain could tighten.[0m
[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 2] [sequential] revision plan: Revise opening to: 'May the myths get cleaned by reason, obey it, and look like history.' for passive wish closeness without stiffness. Simplify abstracts: 'stubbornly ignore what's believable' to 'stubbornly ignore what seems true'; 'refuse to blend with what's likely' to 'refuse to mix with what could happen.' Use 'patient listeners who kindly accept old stories' for exact indulgence, avoiding 'gently welcome' formality. Ensure 'we'll need' keeps plural 'us' feel. Test full read-aloud for 7yo smoothness—no changes that add core relations.[0m

Source-close sketch: 'May it be for us, the mythical purified by reason submitting and taking history's face, but wherever it arrogantly scorns the believable and refuses mixture toward the likely, we shall beg understanding hearers mildly receiving the antiquities.' Interpolation tests: Opening—passive wish 'May reason clean the myths so they obey and look like history' (closer to optative process, natural); alt 'I wish the myths would let reason clean them up to seem historical' (conversational, depersonifies slightly); bolder break-syntax 'Reason should scrub myths clean to make them obey and act like history—no more fairy-tale nonsense' (too slangy/cutesy, drop). Contrast—'stubbornly scorn believable/refuse likely mix' to 'won't take what's believable or mix with what's possible' (merges πιθανόν/εἰκός into true/possible for 7yo concrete pics, avoids stacked abstracts); alt 'proudly ignores truth and skips real-life blend' (bolder paraphrase, natural flow); 'where it can't be made believable or possible' (depersonifies fully, plain condition). Ending—'kind listeners who gently accept ancient stories' (fixes 'tales' looseness for ἀρχαιολογίαν as 'old stories/records', patient indulgence natural). Bolder full paraphrase test: 'Use smarts to fix myths into history-like truths. If some bits stay too wild and unreal, hope for patient friends okay with ancient yarns' (breaks to event-style, super-readable but drops wish tone/contrast precision—keep hybrid). Chosen: passive-ish opening for faithfulness, depersonify contrast slightly, simple verbs/nouns (clean/follow/look, refuse/mix, kind/patient/old stories), short sentences, explicit refs.
