            "faithful": "The faithful translation excels in preserving the Greek's optative wish (εἴη), passive participle (ἐκκαθαιρόμενον), and precise terms like 'plausible' (πιθανοῦ) and 'probable' (εἰκός), accurately conveying the conditional structure without additions. Readable and modern versions err by altering 'hear [it] being purified' (ὑπακοῦσαι τὸ μυθῶδες ἐκκαθαιρόμενον) into active 'purify the mythical' or 'heeding it,' shifting agency and introducing extraneous words like 'elements' or 'rational discourse.' While readable and modern enhance flow and contemporary idiom, they compromise core meaning, especially in the contrast clause; faithfulness remains paramount as it honors the text's logical progression from purified myth to demanding indulgent hearers for unalloyed antiquity.",
            "readable": "The faithful translation excels in literal adherence, preserving the Greek infinitive structure of hearing the mythical 'being purified' by reason and the precise 'mixture with the probable,' but its formal phrasing reduces readability. The readable version prioritizes smooth flow with vivid terms like 'glimpse' and 'blend,' yet sacrifices faithfulness by rephrasing 'hear it being purified' into an active 'purify... heeding it,' which introduces extraneous meaning. The modern translation strikes a strong balance, enhancing readability and tone with contractions and 'rational discourse,' though it slightly embellishes with 'mythical elements' and shifts 'probable' to 'probability.' Overall, prioritizing readability demands fixing inaccuracies without losing fluency.",
            "modern": "The faithful translation prioritizes literal precision, accurately capturing the passive purification by reason and distinctions between πιθανός (plausible) and εἰκός (probable), but its formal tone feels dated. Readable and modern versions enhance flow with 'ideal' and contractions, boosting readability and modernity, yet they introduce liberties like active 'purify' instead of passive 'being purified' and 'our ancient lore/inquiries,' slightly diluting faithfulness. With modernity as priority, the modern translation leads by balancing accessibility and contemporary phrasing, though all could refine 'ὄψιν' beyond 'glimpse' for sharper historical insight."

            "faithful": "The faithful translation stands out for its precise retention of Greek structures, such as explicitly naming 'the mythical' as the persistent subject and preserving 'mixture with the probable' to mirror πρὸς τὸ εἰκὸς μῖξιν exactly. Readable and modern versions prioritize fluency by simplifying to 'it,' 'blend,' and casual phrasing like 'best/great' or 'real look,' but this sacrifices the optative nuance of εἴη (not strongly 'best') and the visual exactness of ὄψιν (not merely 'glimpse/look'). While readability enhances accessibility and modernity adds contemporary appeal, they dilute εὐγνωμόνων ('sensible/good-minded,' implying discernment) to vaguer 'understanding' and overlook the participle ἐκκαθαιρόμενον's ongoing 'being purified.' Faithfulness must lead to uphold philosophical subtlety, with minor tweaks for flow without compromising accuracy.",
            "readable": "The faithful translation maintains high precision to the Greek optative wish ('would be well') and literal phrasing like 'receive a view of history,' but its repetition of 'the mythical' hinders smooth readability. The readable version enhances flow with 'gain a glimpse' and 'blend,' making it more accessible while preserving core meaning, though 'best' slightly amplifies the optative. The modern translation amps up casualness with contractions and 'great,' boosting modernity and readability but diluting the nuanced 'well' and formal tone of the original.",
            "modern": "The faithful translation prioritizes literal accuracy with terms like 'scorns the plausible' and 'mixture with the probable,' but its formal structure hinders modern readability and tone. The readable version enhances flow with 'gain a glimpse' and 'blend,' improving accessibility while mostly preserving meaning, though 'best' slightly amplifies 'well.' The modern translation advances casual vibe via 'It'd be great' and 'we'll need,' yet 'real look' introduces interpretive flair that risks faithfulness, underscoring the challenge of balancing punchy modernity with precision."

Readability is enhanced through streamlined infinitives, natural 'catch a glimpse' for λαβεῖν ἱστορίας ὄψιν, and fluid conditional structure without repetition.

Whom shall I set against him? Who is reliable?' it seemed best to oppose and compare the founder of beautiful and much-sung Athens to the father of unconquered and greatly renowned Rome.\n\nIt would be well for us, then, to hear the mythical being purified by reason and catch a glimpse of history; but wherever it arrogantly scorns the plausible and refuses the mixture with the probable, we'll need discerning listeners who gently welcome the ancient inquiry."
