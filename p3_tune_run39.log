[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 1] [sequential] judgment: Strong readability and modernity for a young audience, but faithfulness dips due to voice shift from impersonal optative wish to personal 'I hope', and some words like 'stubbornly' and 'likelihood' exceed 7yo plainness.[0m
[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 1] [sequential] strengths: Smooth two-sentence flow with plain clauses; everyday verbs like 'clean up' and 'look like' express purification and 'history's face' directly; merges contrasts naturally without dropping core wish-then-exception structure; avoids abstract chains and reference borrowing.[0m
[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 1] [sequential] issues: Changes source's impersonal 'may it be for us' (εἴη...ἡμῖν) to personal 'I hope to', losing communal wish tone; 'clear thinking' for λόγῳ is vague vs precise 'reason'; 'stubbornly ignore what's believable' personifies well but 'stubbornly' and 'believable' are not everyday 7yo words; 'blend with likelihood' uses advanced 'likelihood' instead of plain 'what's likely'; 'patiently welcome' softens πρᾴως (mildly) but adds unneeded 'patiently'; 'ancient tales' simplifies ἀρχαιολογίαν but risks understating 'ancient records/lore'.[0m

[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 2] [sequential] judgment: Strong iteration that captures core intent and contrast in plain modern terms, but second sentence piles clauses awkwardly for a 7-year-old reader, risking confusion on the 'mix' idea and abstract contrasts.[0m
[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 2] [sequential] strengths: Smooth two-sentence flow preserves source contrast without Greek-shaped hypotheticals; 'clean up the myths with clear thinking' directly renders purification via reason in everyday kid language; 'true history' nails visual 'face of history'; 'kind listeners who welcome...with patience' modernizes indulgent hearers concretely.[0m
[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 2] [sequential] issues: Second sentence crams 'stubbornly reject what's believable and refuse to mix with what's likely' into one clause chain, creating abstraction stack that's indirect for 7yo (better as outcome: won't blend with real possibilities); 'listeners' archaic for written context (refs use readers, but prioritize natural modern); 'what's believable/likely' repeats similar ideas without merging for flow; minor personification of myths feels forced when plain outcome ('won't fit real events') would clarify.[0m
