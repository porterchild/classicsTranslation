Bolder paraphrase breaking syntax: 'I want to fix myths with smart thinking to make them true-sounding history. When that's impossible, please be nice and accept the old legends as they are.'

Kid test: Short sentences win - 'reason cleans' natural over 'purify/submit'; everyday verbs like 'fix/clean/mix' over 'purify/refuse'; drop personification for process ('won't blend'); explicit subjects avoid chains.

            "issues": "Personifies myths too literally ('they obey it,' 'stubbornly ignore,' 'refuse to mix') as clunky translationese—feels like Greek verbs calqued onto myths instead of natural process phrasing (e.g., source has mythical element submitting, not myths as agents); 'what's believable/likely' repeats near-synonyms awkwardly when one term could clarify; 'listeners' archaic for reading context (refs use 'readers'); singular 'I hope/I will ask' drifts from plural 'us/we'; 'clean up' slightly loose vs precise 'purify'; no cutesy/slang but 'real history' adds casual edge risking tone dilution.",

Source-close: 'May it be for us, the mythical being purified by argument, to hear/obey and take history's face, but wherever it arrogantly scorns the persuasive and rejects mixture toward the likely, we shall beg understanding hearers who mildly receive the ancient inquiry.' Interpolation for 7yo: Blend into 'We hope to use reason to clean myths so they look like real history.

Hard parts exploration: Purify mythical with reason—options: 'clean myths with reason/thinking' (simple), 'wash away silly parts using logic' (concrete but risks cutesy), 'make myths sensible via reason' (direct); submit & history face → 'obey and look like history' (personifies), better depersonify 'so they seem true/real history' or 'turn into history-like'; arrogant scorn persuasive/refuse probable mix → 'stubbornly ignore believable/won't blend likely' (repetitive), merge to 'won't become believable' or 'refuse to fit what's possible'; beg kind indulgent hearers for ancient → 'ask kind readers who patiently accept old tales/stories' (modernize 'hearers' to 'readers', 'archeologia' as 'stories' not 'inquiry' for 7yo). Personification test: Myths as agents ('they refuse') feels forced/cartoonish for dignity—depersionify to process 'where it can't be made...' Bolder paraphrase breaking syntax: 'Let's scrub myths clean with logic to make them true-sounding history. For impossible bits that won't budge, dear kind readers, please enjoy the ancient yarns!'
