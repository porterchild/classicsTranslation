[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 1] [sequential] judgment: Strong first iteration: captures core intent and contrast faithfully while hitting 7yo readability with plain clauses and everyday words like 'make-believe' and 'clean up'; flows naturally but minor personification and phrasing tweaks needed for smoother dignity.[0m
[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 1] [sequential] strengths: Smooth two-sentence structure mirrors source contrast without Greek mirroring; 'make-believe parts' perfectly kids-ifies μυθῶδες; 'clean up...look like true history' directly conveys purification to history's face; preserves wish/beg dynamic as 'I hope...I ask'; natural modern flow avoids archaic terms.[0m
[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 1] [sequential] issues: 'Clear thinking' abstracts λόγῳ (reason)—feels slightly bookish vs plain 'reason'; 'they stubbornly reject what seems real' personifies well but 'what seems real' undersells πιθανόν (plausible/believable) as everyday 'makes sense'; 'blend with what could happen' stacks abstractions for πρὸς τὸ εἰκὸς μῖξιν—in kid terms, sounds vague vs 'mix with what's likely'; 'listeners' literal for ἀκροατῶν but context implies readers; 'patiently welcome' dignifies πρᾴως but could plainify to 'gently accept'.[0m

[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 2] [sequential] judgment: Strong simplification for child readability while preserving core contrast and intent, but hampered by advanced vocab like 'scorns' and slight abstraction in 'what makes sense/likely' that a 7yo might stumble over.[0m
[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 2] [sequential] strengths: Smooth two-sentence flow with plain clauses; 'clean up the make-believe' vividly simplifies 'purify the mythical' in everyday terms; captures wishful tone via 'I hope' and direct plea to readers; merges 'obeys and looks like' naturally without dropping visual metaphor; 'old tales' fits 'archaeologia' contextually for myths.[0m
[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 2] [sequential] issues: 'Scorns' is archaic and above 7yo level (feels bookish); 'what makes sense' and 'what's likely' stack abstractions for 'pithanou/eikos' without grounding in kid terms like 'things that could happen'; personified 'it' (myth) works but risks pronoun confusion for young readers; 'stubbornly' dignified but pairs with fancy 'scorns' to feel stiff.[0m
[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 2] [sequential] revision plan: Replace 'stubbornly scorns what makes sense' with 'won't fit with things that could be true' to flatten both refusals into one plain clause preserving contrast; swap 'make-believe' to 'myth stories' for directness if needed, but keep if vivid; change 'I ask kind readers who gently welcome' to 'I'll ask nice listeners to kindly accept' for smoother pronoun flow and 7yo words; full rewrite proposal: 'I hope to use reason to clean up myth stories so they obey and look like real history.
