Hard parts options: Opener - 'May we purify myths with reason till they obey and look historical' (formal) vs. 'Let’s use reason to clean myths so they follow it and seem true' (kid-flow) vs. 'I wish reason could cleanse myths to make them like history' (personal shift, avoid); pivot: 'May reason cleanse myths so they submit and wear history's face' -> kid: 'May we clean myths with thinking so they act like true stories.' Contrast: 'But where it stubbornly scorns plausibility/refuses likely mix' -> 'But if myths won't mix with what makes sense' (merge, natural); 'where it can't be made believable' (de-personify fully). End: 'need good-judging hearers mildly receiving archaeology' -> 'kind listeners who gently accept old lore/tales/records' (preserve 'ancient' specificity, no generic 'stories'). Test phrasings: 1) 'May we use reason to purify myths, making them obey and look like history. But where they refuse to blend with believable ideas, we'll need nice listeners who kindly welcome ancient tales.' (simple, flows). 2) 'Let reason wash myths clean so they follow it and seem historical. If they stubbornly ignore what's likely, I need patient hearers for old accounts.' (cutesy 'wash', shift 'I'). 3) 'May we purify the fanciful with logic, till it yields and resembles history. Yet if it defies credibility and shuns probability, beg indulgent readers for antiquity's sake.' (abstract/modern article but less kid). Choose 1 variant: opener 'May we...' keeps wish/dignity; 'clean... with reason' (purify=deep clean, kid-ok vs. prior 'clean up'); single 'believable' merges duo naturally (core: credibility); 'kind listeners... gently welcome ancient tales' sharpens prior dilution, preserves εὐγνωμόνων/πρᾴως/ἀρχαιολογίαν.
