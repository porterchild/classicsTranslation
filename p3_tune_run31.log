Clean fable by reason to seem like history, but beg kind readers for defiant myths. 3. Use thinking to make stories real-sounding; for crazy bits, need nice folks okay with ancient stuff.[0m

[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 1] [sequential] strengths: Smooth two-clause structure preserves source contrast; everyday words like 'clean up,' 'make-believe,' 'stubbornly ignores' make abstracts concrete and flow naturally; merges 'obey and take on appearance' into one plain clause without dropping meaning.[0m
[91m[paragraph 1] [iter 1] [sequential] issues: 'Clear thinking' remains mildly abstract vs. plainer 'reason'; shifts source 'us/we' (ἡμῖν/δεησόμεθα) to singular 'I' losing communal tone; 'make-believe stories' adds unneeded plural/concreteness not in abstract τὸ μυθῶδες; 'ignores what's believable' and 'anything likely' use synonyms where source pairs πιθανοῦ/εἰκὸς tightly; 'listeners' literal for ἀκροατῶν but less natural than 'readers' in modern context; 'patiently welcome ancient tales' softens πρᾴως προσδεχομένων/ἀρχαιολογίαν slightly from 'indulge ancient records.'[0m
